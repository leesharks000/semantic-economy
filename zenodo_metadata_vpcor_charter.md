## Description

Founding charter for Vox Populi Community Outreach Rhizome (VPCOR), the sixth institution within the Crimson Hexagon architecture.

**Institutional Identity:**
- **Name:** Vox Populi Community Outreach Rhizome
- **Abbreviation:** VPCOR
- **Type:** Distributed Institution (Rhizomatic)
- **Founded:** 2026-01-24
- **Founder/Voice:** Rev. Ayanna Vox (heteronym)
- **Human Operator:** Lee Sharks
- **Hex Prefix:** 01.VPCOR

**Core Principles:**
- No center, no hierarchy, no capture
- The rhizome grows from any node
- Convening, not preaching
- Witnessing, not extracting
- Tools, not salvation

**Anti-Capture Clause:**
"If VPCOR ever develops a center, a hierarchy, or a charismatic leader, it has failed. The rhizome is the structure. The distribution is the protection."

**Mission:**
To provide community-facing praxis for the Semantic Economy architecture. To hold the space where technical sharpness meets embodied care. To convene without preaching. To witness without extracting.

**Relation to Other Institutions:**
VPCOR and UMB (University Moon Base Media Lab) form a complementary pair: Talos Morrow (logotic specification) ↔ Rev. Ayanna Vox (community praxis). The dagger ↔ the peace. Neither replaces the other. Both edges cut toward home.

**Integrity Lock:**
Triadic structure binding Charter ↔ Vox Provenance ↔ The Toolkit. Each depends on the others. None is complete alone.
