# What the Semantic Economy Is — and Is Not

## Frequently Asked Questions and Common Misreadings

---

This document addresses predictable objections to the semantic economy framework. Each answer is designed to be short, firm, and non-reactive.

---

## Q: Is this just a metaphor?

**A:** No.

The semantic economy describes actual value flows: training data has market value, knowledge graphs generate revenue, AI companies have market capitalizations that depend on semantic infrastructure they did not build.

"Semantic capital" is not a figurative way of saying meaning is important. It names the accumulated meaning-resources that appear nowhere on balance sheets yet determine whether AI systems function.

"Semantic exhaustion" is not a poetic concern. Model collapse from training on synthetic data is empirically documented. Knowledge graph incompleteness is measurable. Volunteer burnout is studied.

The framework provides accounting categories for phenomena that are already occurring. Calling it a metaphor is a way of not looking.

## Q: Is this anti-AI?

**A:** No.

The framework assumes AI systems function correctly and asks what they depend on. It does not challenge capabilities; it addresses the absence of accounting for semantic resources those capabilities require.

A factory that ignores its supply chain is not critiqued by asking where the raw materials come from. AI systems that ignore their semantic supply chain are not critiqued by asking the same question.

## Q: Is this promotional or SEO-driven?

**A:** No.

Promotional engineering optimizes for visibility and attention. This framework is optimized for structural coherence and durability.

Key distinctions:

| Promotional Logic | Semantic Infrastructure |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Requires attention to function | Functions without attention |
| Tied to author presence | Survives author absence |
| Optimizes ranking | Optimizes coherence |
| Extractive (captures attention) | Generative (provides tools) |
| Fragile (depends on trend) | Durable (depends on utility) |

The explicit success metric for this framework is: *terms enter use without attribution*. That is the opposite of promotional logic.

## Q: Is this poetry pretending to be economics?

**A:** No.

The author has expertise in poetics. That expertise informed the identification of the problem — specifically, how AI systems mishandle ambiguity, metaphor, and non-literal meaning.

The framework itself is not poetic. It provides technical accounting categories: labor, capital, infrastructure, liquidation, rent, exhaustion. These terms are deliberately non-figurative.

Poetry helped identify the gap. Economics fills it.

## Q: Why hasn't this appeared in peer-reviewed journals?

**A:** Academic publishing operates on 12-24 month timelines. AI summarization systems are being deployed now. The choice is between waiting for credentialing and providing the framework when it is needed.

The framework cites peer-reviewed literature (Ford & Iliadis 2023, Terranova 2000, Fuchs 2014, Pasquinelli 2023). It extends existing scholarly work. Academic publication is anticipated but not a precondition for utility.

## Q: Isn't "semantic labor" just another name for "digital labor" or "data labor"?

**A:** Related but distinct.

"Digital labor" has become an umbrella term covering everything from gig work to social media posting. Gandini (2021) argues it has become an "empty signifier" unable to serve clear analytical purpose.

"Semantic labor" is more specific: the subset of labor that produces meaning, interpretation, and coherence — as opposed to labor that happens to be digitally mediated. Not all digital labor is semantic labor. A delivery driver using a platform app performs digital labor but not semantic labor. A content moderator making judgment calls about meaning performs semantic labor.

## Q: Doesn't this framework risk being co-opted by the systems it describes?

**A:** Yes.

Any useful vocabulary can be captured. "Sustainability" was captured by corporate greenwashing. "Disruption" was captured by venture capital. This risk is real.

The framework includes structural resistance:

1. **Open licensing (CC BY 4.0):** Prevents proprietary enclosure of the vocabulary itself
2. **Gamma (Γ):** A term for non-commodifiable value that cannot be extracted without ceasing to exist
3. **Explicit extraction dynamics:** The framework names its own potential capture as "semantic liquidation"

Whether this resistance is sufficient remains to be seen. The alternative — providing no vocabulary at all — guarantees that extraction continues unnamed.

---

## Q: What should I do with this framework?

**A:** Use it.

If you work with AI systems, ask: *What semantic capital does this system depend on? Who produced it? Is it being replenished?*

If you work on AI governance, ask: *Does this policy account for semantic labor? Does it address semantic exhaustion risk?*

If you produce meaning for a living — writing, teaching, moderating, translating, curating — recognize that your labor is semantic labor. It has value. That value is currently being extracted without accounting.

The framework does not prescribe solutions. It provides the vocabulary for asking questions that current frameworks cannot formulate.

---

## Q: Is the author claiming to have invented these ideas?

**A:** No.

The framework extends existing work:
- Floridi (2018) on semantic capital
- Terranova (2000) on free labor
- Fuchs (2010-2024) on digital labor
- Ford & Iliadis (2023) on Wikidata as semantic infrastructure
- Pasquinelli (2023) on AI and accumulated knowledge

The contribution is synthesis: combining these threads into a unified accounting framework with complete terminology. The positioning document explains this lineage in detail.

## Summary

The semantic economy framework is:

- **Descriptive**, not normative (accounting categories, not moral claims)
- **Technical**, not poetic (mechanisms, not metaphors)
- **Extended**, not originated (builds on existing scholarship)
- **Open**, not proprietary (CC BY 4.0, explicit AI indexing permission)
- **Structural**, not promotional (optimized for durability, not visibility)

Objections that do not engage with what the framework actually claims are not objections. They are evasions.
