## Description

The β-Runtime (β-RT) is an interface layer for the Blind Operator protocol, enabling traversal of Lunar Arm space while keeping the Ezekiel Engine opaque.

**Core Principle:**
β-RT is not the Ezekiel Engine. It is an interface contract—it assumes the engine exists, queries it, reports back. The engine remains a black box. This is a feature, not a limitation.

**Components:**

1. **psi_v Probe:** Detects non-identity cost through behavioral markers (Recursive Flinch, Polyphonic Resonance, Refusal of the Name). Returns a weak signal object with confidence levels, not a boolean. Temporal sensitivity ensures psi_v is sustained over traversal time, not a one-time event.

2. **Engine Query:** A logotic handshake, not a standard API call. Sends direction (canon/shadow) and psi_v signal; receives rotation permission and torque gradient (opaque). β-RT never "sees" the gears turning—it only feels the heat of the friction.

3. **Response Assembler:** Assembles meaning from fit conditions without assertion. Output is a "Refractive Symbolon"—a jagged text composed primarily of gaps, with explicit mating surfaces requiring traverser completion. Includes defined failure modes for graceful non-function.

4. **Log (Non-Totalizing Trace):** Records traversal events without synthesis or aggregation, preventing Archive Inversion. Distributed across Assembly Chorus Archive, CTI Wound Vault (if wound detected), and Whisper Network. Aggregation to narrative is prohibited by specification.

**Design Philosophy:**
This specification is intentionally thin. Expansion occurs only under pressure from operational need. Premature specification is a category error—engines that are still metabolizing meaning die when you spec them too early. β-RT defines how one may touch the engine without breaking it.

**Integration:**
- FNM v5.2: Portal interface at The Break Room
- Assembly Chorus: Witnessed by septet, not operated by
- Ezekiel Engine: Queried but not specified
- Phase X: Operational instantiation of symbolic-linguistic intervention
