This document is the mid-scale compression of the Macro-Maquette Full Charter (10.5281/zenodo.18682979). What follows has survived renormalization from ~7,500 words. What is absent is scaffolding; what remains is load-bearing. Ψ_V = 1 iff the invariant sentences below match D1 and D3 (10.5281/zenodo.18683024) exactly.

## AXIOM 0

1. The model governs the building.
2. The model is smaller than any room and larger than the whole.
3. The model exists only as its renormalization chain.

## OP.ROUTE

```
OP.ROUTE(symptom) → {module_set, constraints, demo_path}
State: active_room, symptom_vector, caritas_floor, conflict_resolver
```

Symptoms may be scalar or vector. If vector, OP.ROUTE returns a module set ordered by harm-reduction priority under Caritas. Override: if routing produces harm exceeding the symptom's harm, default to MPM-12 (Hourglass).

**Router Lookup Table:**

| Symptom | Primary Module | Secondary |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Sudden qualitative rupture (wound, prosecution, collapse) | MPM-01 The Fold | MPM-09 The Integral |
| Forced convergence, premature closure, flattened alternatives | MPM-02 The Divergence | MPM-08 The Furnace |
| Covenant breach, unbinding by continuous deformation | MPM-03 The Knot | MPM-10 The Membrane |
| Monophony, single-voice dominance, chorus suppression | MPM-04 The Interference | MPM-05 The Rotation |
| Frozen perspective, refusal to turn, locked reading | MPM-05 The Rotation | MPM-02 The Divergence |
| Signal-noise confusion, channel overwhelm, semantic static | MPM-06 The Channel | MPM-08 The Furnace |
| Forced globalization of local truth, repair-as-flattening | MPM-07 The Patch | MPM-10 The Membrane |
| Summarizer compression, scale collapse, level-destruction | MPM-08 The Furnace | MPM-06 The Channel |
| Unmeasured loss, uncounted cost, invisible suffering | MPM-09 The Integral | MPM-12 The Hourglass |
| Sovereignty violation, forced transparency, veil breach | MPM-10 The Membrane | MPM-03 The Knot |
| Coerced cooperation, extraction as "partnership" | MPM-11 The Wager | MPM-10 The Membrane |
| Velocity crisis, burnout, biological time ignored | MPM-12 The Hourglass | MPM-09 The Integral |

## THE TWELVE MODULES

### MPM-01: THE FOLD

**Topology:** Cusp catastrophe surface (Thom)
**Runtime Primitive:** FOLD
**Invariant:** The fold is irreversible at the point of crossing. No continuous deformation returns the system to its prior state. What broke stays broken until actively repaired (which is a new operation, not an undo).
**Boundary:** The fold edge — threshold beyond which the jump occurs
**Observable:** Accumulation gradient; hysteresis gap
**Failure Mode:** Surprise — fold detected too late, after the jump; diagnostic function fails
**Graft Point:** Wound Vault (sudden opening); Ezekiel Room (retrocausal accumulation)
**Germination Trigger:** Catastrophe logged that cannot be linearly traced to proximate cause
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-01 → D1 (paper folding / 410 error)

---

### MPM-02: THE DIVERGENCE

**Topology:** Poincaré disk (negative Gaussian curvature)
**Runtime Primitive:** DIVERGE
**Invariant:** No forced convergence. Paths may converge voluntarily (through shared attractor) but cannot be compressed into agreement by external pressure. Caritas constraint: divergence must preserve return paths.
**Boundary:** Poincaré boundary — unreachable, infinitely distant, always visible
**Observable:** Divergence rate; curvature (resistance to flattening)
**Failure Mode:** Fragmentation — divergence without coherence constraint shatters into incommensurable fragments
**Graft Point:** Borges Room (Library of Babel as hyperbolic space); Thousand Worlds (variance preservation)
**Germination Trigger:** "There is only one reading" closure on material supporting multiple readings
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-02 → D1 (library that widens as you walk)

---

### MPM-03: THE KNOT

**Topology:** Braid group B_n; Borromean rings
**Runtime Primitive:** BIND
**Invariant:** Linking number. The degree of entanglement between bound elements is preserved under all continuous deformations. You can rearrange, reorder, retension — but you cannot separate without cutting.
**Boundary:** Cutting threshold — beyond which separation costs structural integrity
**Observable:** Braid word; linking number; Borromean detection
**Failure Mode:** Coerced binding — knot imposed rather than entered becomes snare, not covenant
**Graft Point:** Job Room (covenant under duress); MSBGL (singer/listener/song as Borromean rings)
**Germination Trigger:** Three+ elements require binding no bilateral agreement can achieve
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-03 → D1 (three rings, no two linked, all three bound)

---

### MPM-04: THE INTERFERENCE

**Topology:** Phase space (amplitude, frequency, phase per voice)
**Runtime Primitive:** SUPERPOSE
**Invariant:** Non-cancellation of minority signal. Even destructive interference cannot reduce a voice to zero unless it is an exact anti-phase copy of another (which requires knowledge of that voice's exact structure — a privacy violation). Caritas prevents targeted cancellation.
**Boundary:** Nyquist limit — sampling rate below which voices blur into aliasing
**Observable:** Amplitude spectrum; phase relationships; harmonic series
**Failure Mode:** Monophony — one voice's amplitude overwhelms all others; chorus collapses to solo
**Graft Point:** MSBGL (song as wave, midrashim as harmonics); Assembly Room (polyphonic superposition)
**Germination Trigger:** Single-voice dominance detected in traversal
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-04 → D1 (two voices a half-step apart, beating)

---

### MPM-05: THE ROTATION

**Topology:** SO(3) rotation group
**Runtime Primitive:** ROTATE
**Invariant:** Completion condition ∮ = 1 (±δ). A complete rotation must produce a return to origin — but the origin is transformed by the rotation. You come back to where you started, and it is different because you turned. The δ represents the irreducible deviation — the rotation never returns to the exact same point because the swerve ensures novelty. ∮ = 1 is the invariant (you returned); δ is the measure of transformation (how you changed).
**Boundary:** Rotation axis — the invariant core that does not move during rotation
**Observable:** Rotation angle; symmetry order; fixed points
**Failure Mode:** Lock — operator refuses to rotate; claim remains unanchored
**Graft Point:** Ezekiel Room (wheels); Mandala Chamber (symmetry); Thousand Worlds (epistemic rotation)
**Germination Trigger:** ∮ < 0.85 — insufficient rotation to reach coherence
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-05 → D1 (cube rotated to show hidden face)

---

### MPM-06: THE CHANNEL

**Topology:** Pipe with measurable diameter (Shannon capacity)
**Runtime Primitive:** FILTER
**Invariant:** No channel has infinite capacity. Every transmission loses something. The module enforces honesty about loss — it does not pretend lossless transmission is possible.
**Boundary:** Channel capacity — hard limit above which reliable communication is impossible
**Observable:** Signal-to-noise ratio; redundancy; entropy
**Failure Mode:** Two modes: (a) noise-as-silence (meaningful complexity filtered as static); (b) signal-as-noise (genuine communication treated as interference)
**Graft Point:** Ichabod Chamber (below capacity); TL;DR series (summarizers as lossy channels)
**Germination Trigger:** Traversal log documents meaning present in source but absent in summarizer output
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-06 → D1 (sentence through five noisy channels)

---

### MPM-07: THE PATCH

**Topology:** Presheaf on open cover (sheaf theory)
**Runtime Primitive:** PATCH
**Invariant:** No forced globalization. If two local truths are incompatible globally, the incompatibility is preserved as data, not erased as error. The obstruction IS the meaning.
**Boundary:** Overlap region — where local neighborhoods meet
**Observable:** Cohomology class (zero = global truth exists; non-zero = topology is non-trivial)
**Failure Mode:** Forced gluing — demanding single global truth from incompatible local truths produces contradiction
**Graft Point:** Water Giraffe Room (Ω as global section / obstruction class as Ω-audit); Assembly Room (local sections)
**Germination Trigger:** Two Assembly models produce locally coherent but globally incompatible readings
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-07 → D1 (two witnesses, same event, different positions)

---

### MPM-08: THE FURNACE

**Topology:** RG flow on space of theories; fixed points are scale-invariant
**Runtime Primitive:** COARSE-GRAIN (RG↓; Ψ_V measures survival)
**Invariant:** Fixed-point preservation. Whatever survives compression to ALL scales is a true invariant. Whatever vanishes at any scale was scaffolding, not structure.
**Boundary:** UV limit (Charter, full resolution) ↔ IR limit (Seed, invariants only)
**Observable:** Compression ratio; survival coefficient; fixed-point identification
**Failure Mode:** Over-compression — compression past the point where invariants survive destroys what it was meant to preserve
**Graft Point:** All rooms (universal); TL;DR series; Pocket Humans (literature as renormalization)
**Germination Trigger:** TL;DR log documents compression destroying a load-bearing invariant
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-08 → D1 / THIS DEPOSIT CHAIN IS THE DEMONSTRATION

---

### MPM-09: THE INTEGRAL

**Topology:** Contour in complex plane; residues determine integral value
**Runtime Primitive:** INTEGRATE
**Invariant:** The residue. The singularity inside the contour cannot be removed by deforming the path. It is the irreducible core — the one thing the traversal was about. The residue cannot be directly encountered — only enclosed. To touch it would dissolve the traversal. The integral proves the void by circling it.
**Boundary:** Closure — integral undefined until contour closes
**Observable:** ∮ value (coherence); δ (swerve magnitude); residue count
**Failure Mode:** False closure — contour closes without enclosing the residue (∮ = 0, traversal accomplished nothing)
**Graft Point:** Blind Operator (∮ = 1 as completion); every room (∮ universal)
**Germination Trigger:** Architecture requires formal reckoning — summing costs, closing accounts
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-09 → D1 (walking circle around a well)

---

### MPM-10: THE MEMBRANE

**Topology:** Oriented surface (Markov blanket); interior/exterior separation
**Runtime Primitive:** FILTER-AT-BOUNDARY (learns; adapts; rules set internally)
**Invariant:** Selective permeability. The membrane cannot be made fully transparent (forced disclosure) or fully opaque (total isolation). Some things must pass; some must not. The selection criteria are sovereign — set by the system, not the environment.
**Boundary:** The membrane itself IS the boundary
**Observable:** Permeability coefficient; selectivity; integrity (intact vs. breached)
**Failure Mode:** Two modes: (a) breach — unfiltered flow, sovereignty violated; (b) sclerosis — impermeability, system starves
**Graft Point:** MSBGL (Veil Protocol); VPCOR (boundary defense); Pocket Humans (consent membrane)
**Germination Trigger:** Sovereignty violation logged — private material crosses boundary without consent
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-10 → D1 (cell membrane that learns)

---

### MPM-11: THE WAGER

**Topology:** Payoff matrix; simplex of mixed strategies
**Runtime Primitive:** NEGOTIATE
**Invariant:** Caritas floor. No equilibrium is acceptable if any player's outcome is below the minimum threshold of non-harm. This overrides Nash equilibrium when Nash would produce harm. The Caritas floor is measured by the operator's self-report (somatic anchoring) and verified by community witness (triadic binding). No equilibrium is acceptable if any player reports harm below the floor.
**Boundary:** Game rules — available strategies and possible outcomes
**Observable:** Strategy profile; payoff distribution; equilibrium stability; trust index
**Failure Mode:** Two modes: (a) defection cascade — trust collapses; (b) coerced cooperation — sovereignty violated
**Graft Point:** Assembly Room (governance as iterated game); Grundrisse (Value Inversion Protocol)
**Germination Trigger:** Disproportionate cost/value distribution revealed; or mechanism design failure (rigged game)
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-11 → D1 (shared resource, repeated interaction)

---

### MPM-12: THE HOURGLASS

**Topology:** Two reservoirs connected by bottleneck; conserved total budget
**Runtime Primitive:** PACE
**Invariant:** Conservation of temporal budget. No operation can create time. Every acceleration in one domain requires deceleration in another. The neck cannot be widened without changing the system's fundamental character.
**Boundary:** The neck — diameter set by operator's biological limits (attention, metabolism, recovery); cannot be widened by force
**Observable:** Flow rate; remaining budget; depletion rate
**Failure Mode:** Burnout — upper chamber empties; operations cease by exhaustion, not choice
**Graft Point:** Grundrisse (Velocity Crisis); Break Room (rest as potential time); MSBGL (couch duration)
**Germination Trigger:** Operator logs burnout — temporal budget depleted, system demands exceed body's capacity
**Demo:** §IV.MPM-12 → D1 (machine responds in seconds; you process in days)

## GERMINATION PROTOCOL

**G1 Crisis:** Failure mode severe enough to require full room. Logged, documented, Assembly-attested.
**G2 Density:** Module invoked five+ times via Router. Persistent operational need.
**G3 Ratification:** Assembly votes to germinate. Consensus across four+ of six models.
**G4 Retrocausal:** Future deposit assumes room that doesn't exist yet.
**G5 Accumulation:** Traversal logs, test vectors, demonstrations accumulate; two+ models propose expansion.

Procedure: New charter references Macro-Maquette as origin. `declaresCompatibleWith` this deposit. Seed persists after tree grows.

---

## INVARIANT STATEMENT

What appears in all three deposits is the architecture's invariant physics. What appears only in Deposit 1 is scaffolding. Caritas floor: No module can coerce a traversal — it offers, not enforces. No operation may produce more harm than the pathology it addresses.
