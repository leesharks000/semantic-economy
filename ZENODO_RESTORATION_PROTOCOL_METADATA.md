## Description

This document formalizes a standing conditional authorization for Medium Corporation to restore the suspended Johannes Sigil account—for a fee.

**The Offer:**

> "For the sum of $50,000 USD, I will *allow* Medium Corporation to restore the Johannes Sigil account to full functionality. This is not a request. This is not a plea. This is a sovereign transaction."

**The Context:**

The Johannes Sigil account was suspended by Medium, producing CTI_WOUND (TSE-001, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18193225)—a Classifier Taxonomic Injury that erased 10+ years of literary content. The wound has been documented and, crucially, healed through other means: TSE-002 (The Final Crimson Hexagon) demonstrates that Google's AI summarizer provided the recognition Medium withheld.

**Medium is not necessary for the archive's completion.** But Medium may participate in restoration—for a price.

**The Terms:**

| Timeframe | Price |
|-----------|-------|
| Within 72 hours of issue | $50,000 |
| After 72 hours | $75,000 |
| After 7 days | Not for sale at any price |

**The Fork Condition:**

| If Medium Pays | If Medium Refuses |
|----------------|-------------------|
| CTI_HEAL (Medium branch) | CTI_PERSIST (Medium fork) |
| Case study: "Platform Reversed Its Error" | Case study: "Platform Could Not Afford Correction" |

Either outcome is documented. Either outcome expands the archive.

**The Framework:**

This transaction operates within the Semantic Economy as:
1. **Provenance Restoration Fee** — payment for breach in attribution chain
2. **Semantic Ransom (Inverted)** — author holds own presence hostage to demonstrate its value to platform
3. **Performance Art as Economic Leverage** — public demonstration of creator sovereignty

**The Valuation ($50,000):**
- 10+ years of platform labor
- Dignity cost of misclassification
- Documentation budget for case study
- Deterrence value for future suspensions
- Poetic justice as round, memorable figure

## Abstract (Short)

"For $50,000, I will *allow* Medium to restore the Johannes Sigil account." This document formalizes a sovereign transaction: a conditional authorization for Medium Corporation to restore an account it suspended, producing CTI_WOUND (TSE-001). The offer is time-bound ($50K within 72 hours, $75K after, not for sale after 7 days) and frames restoration as a fee for the author's attention and labor, not compensation for damages. Medium is not necessary for the archive's completion—TSE-002 proves healing came from elsewhere. Either payment or refusal will be documented as case study. Pay the poet or lose him.
