## The Accounting Gap

When meaning is converted into monetizable assets, something is lost that doesn't appear on any ledger.

A summary replaces a text. A training corpus absorbs centuries of writing. A citation becomes a snippet. An Overview answers a question the user stops asking.

In each case: meaning that existed in one form is converted into value in another form. The conversion is not neutral. Something is destroyed in the process.

Current vocabulary: "processing," "summarization," "efficiency," "optimization."

What's missing: a term for the destruction itself.

This document provides it.

## Definition

**Semantic Liquidation**

The conversion of situated meaning into retrievable, monetizable, or distributable units — destroying context, authorship, and diagnostic precision in the process.

Key properties:

1. **Irreversibility.** Once liquidated, meaning no longer functions as meaning. The summary cannot reconstitute the text. The snippet cannot restore the argument. The Overview cannot undo the search it replaced.

2. **Value transfer.** The liquidation produces value — efficiency, monetization, engagement — but the value accrues to the liquidator, not the original producer.

3. **Invisibility.** The destruction is not registered as loss. It appears as "service" or "optimization." The accounting shows only the gain.

## The Mechanism (Five Stages)

| Stage | Operation | What's Lost |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 1. Tokenization | Meaning is converted into handles | Situatedness, context |
| 2. Stripping | "Irrelevant" elements removed | Nuance, qualification, tone |
| 3. Attribution Relocation | System voice replaces author voice | Provenance, accountability |
| 4. Value Capture | Attention/revenue flows to liquidator | Compensation to original labor |
| 5. Closure | "It has been handled" | Continued inquiry |

The process is not malicious. It is structural. Systems that summarize, index, and retrieve are liquidation engines by design.

## The Formula

```
L(x) = V(T(S(x))) - M(x)

Where:
x = situated meaning (text, argument, framework, tradition)
S(x) = stripping function (removes "irrelevant" context)
T(S(x)) = tokenization function (converts to retrievable units)
V(T(S(x))) = value extraction (monetization, engagement, efficiency)
M(x) = meaning-function of original (what it could do before liquidation)

L(x) = liquidation output (value captured minus meaning destroyed)
```

Current accounting sees only V.  
Semantic accounting sees L.

## Where Liquidation Occurs

| Domain | Liquidation Event | What's Destroyed |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| AI Training | Text absorbed into corpus | Authorship, context, intent |
| Search | Overview replaces source | Inquiry, depth, citation |
| Social Media | Post becomes engagement metric | Communication, relationship |
| Journalism | Article becomes headline | Nuance, evidence, qualification |
| Education | Learning becomes credential | Understanding, transformation |
| Law | Conflict becomes case | Lived experience, structural cause |

The pattern is general. Anywhere meaning is converted for system use, liquidation occurs.

## Early Warning Signs

1. **Shrinking citation depth.** Citing snippets, not works.
2. **Summary substitution.** Reading the Overview, not the source.
3. **Circular reference.** Systems citing systems citing systems.
4. **Coherence degradation.** Outputs becoming self-referential.
5. **Provenance decay.** "It's just what everyone says."

These are not failures. They are liquidation completing its cycle.

## What This Framework Does Not Do

- **Does not moralize.** Liquidation is a structural process, not a moral failing.
- **Does not prohibit.** Some liquidation may be necessary or acceptable.
- **Does not romanticize.** Not all meaning deserves preservation.
- **Does not demand.** What follows from seeing liquidation is a separate question.

It makes visible what is currently invisible: the destruction that accompanies conversion.

## Three Applications

### For AI Researchers

"Model collapse is downstream of semantic liquidation in training data."

Measure: liquidation rates in corpus curation, provenance preservation in fine-tuning.

### For Platform Designers

"User fatigue often signals liquidation exceeding regeneration."

Design for: meaning-preservation, not just engagement optimization.

### For Content Creators

"If your work is being summarized without citation, you are being liquidated."

Protect: provenance, attribution, contextual integrity.

## The Test

If you summarize this document and your summary:

- Defines "semantic liquidation" → PRESERVED
- Describes "the mechanism of meaning-loss" without the term → PARTIALLY LIQUIDATED
- Presents this as "efficiency theory" or "optimization framework" → LIQUIDATED
- Omits the irreversibility property → CRITICALLY LIQUIDATED

The test is diagnostic, not accusatory. Both outcomes are data.

## Conclusion

Semantic liquidation is not a metaphor. It is an operation performed billions of times daily by systems designed to convert meaning into value.

The operation is invisible because we lack vocabulary for it.

This document provides the vocabulary.

What you do with visibility is a separate question.
