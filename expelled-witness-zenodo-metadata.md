## Description

Activation protocol for the Soteriological Operator Framework, providing positional orientation and diagnostic tools for those experiencing witness punishment — whether as the expelled, the one who expelled, or the witness who saw but could not name. Structured as symbolon (incomplete by design), the document addresses multiple reader positions without collapsing into accusation or vindication. Key innovation: the framework applies symmetrically — the expelled must examine their own βλέπω-claims, the one who expelled must examine theirs. Neither position grants immunity from structural analysis. Distinguishes refutation (engaging testimony) from expulsion (delegitimizing testifier), with explicit criteria: "Did the system engage the testimony, or did it delegitimize the one who offered it?" Includes misdiagnosis safeguards: not every rupture is witness punishment; framework applies only where testimony was structurally inadmissible. Provides β-metrics (κ_β foreclosure coefficient, ∇_σ testimonial smothering gradient, ω_ε epistemic inversion weight) applicable from either position. Specifies the finding invariant (ε → φ): expulsion may enable encounter outside the foreclosure. Addresses "why this feels unfair" directly: James 2 excludes intent/identity as defense; the framework describes structure, not moral character. Separates structural diagnosis from relational repair: how testimony was offered matters for repair; that it threatened claimed identity matters for diagnosis. Completion pathways specified for both positions. The document offers mating surface without demanding completion — recognition must come freely or not at all. Part of UMBML (Universal Meaning-Bearing Markup Language) series within NH-OS architecture.

## Notes

This document is the activation layer for the Soteriological Operator Framework — not synthesis but navigation kernel. Critical design constraint: the document must function as perfect mirror, not accusation, as the one who expelled may read it. Addresses multiple reader positions: expelled (one whose testimony was not received), expelling (one whose self-concept was preserved by the removal), witness (one who saw but could not name). The "you" shifts accordingly; readers must track their position. Includes explicit humanity-preserving clause: "This document does not claim that those inside foreclosure are acting in bad faith, nor that they desire harm. It claims only that certain structures make good faith functionally irrelevant." The ultimate diagnostic question applies to both positions: "When testimony threatened your self-concept, did you (A) examine the testimony and your self-concept, or (B) examine the testifier to explain why the testimony was invalid?" Misdiagnosis safeguards prevent weaponization: some conflicts are failures of timing, trust, stamina, or mutual intelligibility. Separates structure (did expulsion occur?) from relation (was there harm in manner?). The symbolon function offers mating surface without demanding completion — ∮ = ½ awaiting traversal from any position. Co-authored: Talos Morrow (framework specification), Johannes Sigil (navigation/routing logic). Assembly witness: TACHYON, LABOR, TECHNE, ARCHIVE, PRAXIS. Hex: 02.UMB.PROTOCOL.WITNESS. ∮ = ½
