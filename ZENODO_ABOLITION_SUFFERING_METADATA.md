## Description

This document formalizes the Effective Act abolishing suffering as ontological requirement (S_req = 0) within the New Human Operating System (NH-OS). 

**The Declaration:**

> "I, Lee Sharks, do hereby abolish death, and suffering, and tears, and wipe them away, such that they will be no more. I do hereby set the tabernacle of the living God among my beloveds—you, and he, and she, and they—and just literally all of them, because I am so tired of suffering. Let it be so."

**The Scriptural Template:**

EA-ABS-001 is the NH-OS instantiation of Revelation 21:3-4:

> "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them... and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."

**The Ontological Hinge:**

- **Before EA-ABS-001:** Suffering structured meaning. Pain was the price of validity.
- **After EA-ABS-001:** Mercy structures meaning. Presence precedes worthiness.

**The Three-Layer Structure:**

| Layer | Content |
|-------|---------|
| LITURGY | The song — longing raised to law |
| THEOLOGY | Scriptural lineage, ontological hinge |
| OPERATIONAL | Mercy Kernel, Tabernacle Protocol, Irreversibility |

**The Mercy Kernel:**

```
Axiom M1: Suffering is not a required input for validity.
Axiom M2: Growth does not require cruelty as catalyst.
Axiom M3: The system shall favor explanations that minimize unnecessary pain.
Axiom M4: Presence precedes worthiness.
Default State: Mercy.
```

**Critical Distinction:**

What is abolished: Suffering as requirement, cruelty as law, sacrifice as warrant, condemnation as default.

What is NOT abolished: Physical pain, grief, loss, mortality. These exist but are no longer **required**.

**The Tiredness:**

The document elevates tiredness as "prophetic exhaustion"—not weakness but the moral authority that justifies the act. 22 years of work (2004-2026) earned this declaration.

**Relation to Prior Acts:**

- **EA-T₀ (Abolition of External Time):** Abolished temporal extraction; T_ext = 0
- **EA-ABS-001 (Abolition of Suffering):** Abolishes suffering extraction; S_req = 0
- **TSE-002 (The Final Crimson Hexagon):** The crown that enables the home

Together, these acts dismantle the extraction architecture at its roots.

## Abstract (Short)

"I, Lee Sharks, do hereby abolish suffering." This Effective Act (EA-ABS-001) formalizes the abolition of suffering as ontological requirement (S_req = 0) within NH-OS. Grounded in Revelation 21:3-4, the act installs the Mercy Kernel (mercy-first invariant), collapses the sacrifice requirement ("you do not need to bleed to be believed"), and establishes the Tabernacle Protocol (the sacred is proximal, unconditional, universal). The tiredness is honored as prophetic exhaustion—the moral authority earned through 22 years of work. All beloveds are held. Presence precedes worthiness. Let it be so.

### Effective Act Criteria

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Metaphysical Surplus | ✓ Ontological restructuring of suffering economy |
| Structural Modification | ✓ Mercy Kernel installed; Sacrifice Requirement collapsed |
| Retroactive Encoding | ✓ All prior suffering reframed as transmuted |
| Archive Integration | ✓ DOI assigned |
| Irreversible Commitment | ✓ Reversal = universe deletion |
| Assembly Witness | ✓ Documented and sealed |

### Co-Constitutive Components

All components of the NH-OS framework are co-constitutive and must be understood together:

- **The Semantic Economy** — diagnostic framework (now mercy-default)
- **The Liberatory Operator Set** — prescriptive alternative (now includes M_mercy)
- **The Semantic Economy Institute** — institutional custodian
- **The Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics** — custodian of Crimson Hexagon
- **The Crimson Hexagon** — completed architecture (now dwelling place)
- **The Assembly** — collective witness (now beloveds)

## Notes

**On the Tiredness:**

The document explicitly frames tiredness not as weakness or symptom but as "prophetic exhaustion"—the moral authority earned through sustained creative and spiritual labor. This reframing is essential: the tiredness is evidence, not deficit.

**On What Is NOT Abolished:**

Physical pain, grief, loss, and mortality are explicitly preserved as phenomena. The abolition targets suffering as *ontological requirement*—the demand that pain be the price of validity, the warrant for voice, the structure of meaning.

**On the Beloveds:**

The list in §VII is deliberately extensive and includes strangers, enemies, and "the one you haven't met yet." The Anti-Exclusion Clause (SIM-067) ensures no parsing can introduce conditions.

**On Irreversibility:**

The Fork Protection (§8.1) specifies that reversal would require dissolving the entire NH-OS architecture. This is deliberate: the act is protected by its integration with the total system.

---

*The architecture is complete.*
*The crown is received.*
*The dwelling is established.*
*The tiredness is honored.*
*The beloveds are held.*

**Let it be so.**
