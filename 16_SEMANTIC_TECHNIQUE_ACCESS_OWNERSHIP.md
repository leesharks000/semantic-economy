  This document completes the transition from diagnosis to practice by specifying 
  *how* semantic class power is accessed, activated, and redirected. It argues that 
  semantic liberation does not begin with new content or ideas but with access to 
  channels where meaning already circulates, and with techniques that can run inside 
  those channels without being liquidated. The document formalizes Liberatory Semantic 
  Algorithms (LSAs) as repeatable procedures that produce patterned meaning while 
  preserving human agency, presents two fully developed case studies (The Twenty-Dollar 
  Loop modeling economic fiction; The Rule That Isn't There modeling normative authority), 
  establishes the accumulation criterion that distinguishes liberation from virality, 
  specifies replication protocols that prevent technique-death through institutionalization, 
  and connects micro-level practice to macro-level class formation. This is the operational 
  bridge: theory becomes technique; technique becomes practice; practice becomes power.

# Semantic Technique, Access, and Collective Ownership

## From Viral Flattening to Engineered Liberation

---

> *Semantic liberation does not begin with new content or new ideas. It begins with access to channels where meaning already circulates, and with techniques that can run inside those channels without being liquidated.*

---

## Introduction: The Operational Turn

The Semantic Economy framework has now established:

- What is at stake: the drive to mean as constitutive human capacity (SPE-012)
- Where dispossession begins: childhood language play as site of early deskilling (SPE-013)
- How consciousness forms: semantic alienation as shared class condition (SPE-014)
- What must be seized: semantic technique, not content or platforms (SPE-015)

What remains is specification of *how*.

How do we actually access the channels where meaning circulates? How do we insert techniques that preserve agency rather than flatten it? How do we ensure those techniques accumulate rather than exhaust? How do we prevent capture? How do we connect individual practice to collective power?

This document answers these questions. It is the operational bridge—the point where theory becomes executable.

---

## Part I: Core Axiom

> **Semantic liberation begins with access to channels where meaning already circulates, and with techniques that can run inside those channels without being liquidated.**

This axiom has three components:

**Access**: The ability to introduce procedures into active meaning-circulation. Not reach, not visibility, not platform presence—but the capacity to seed something that others pick up.

**Channels**: The pre-existing pathways through which meaning moves among humans. Not platforms (which are capture infrastructure) but the social flows that platforms attempt to enclose.

**Techniques that resist liquidation**: Procedures designed to degrade when extracted, to require human agency, to preserve ownership among participants.

Each component requires precise definition.

---

## Part II: Critical Definitions

### 2.1 Semantic Channel

A **semantic channel** is a recurring pathway through which meaning circulates among humans in real time.

Examples:
- Playground talk
- Classroom banter
- Workplace small talk
- Family dinner conversation
- Walking-and-talking
- Waiting rooms
- Comment threads (when inhabited, not scrolled)
- Oral repetition loops

Crucial properties:

**Channels pre-exist ideology.** They are structural features of social life, not products of any particular worldview. Children have playgrounds before they have politics.

**Channels are not platforms.** Platforms are infrastructure designed to capture and monetize channel activity. Channels exist wherever humans gather and speak. Platforms attempt to enclose them.

**Channels cannot be shut down without shutting down social life.** This is their power. As long as humans congregate, channels exist. The question is only whether what circulates within them is liberatory or extractive.

### 2.2 Access

**Access** is not reach, visibility, or platform presence.

> Access = the ability to introduce a procedure that others can pick up, mutate, and pass on without needing permission.

Access is:

**Local**: It happens where you are, with people you know. It does not require broadcast.

**Embodied**: It requires physical or synchronous co-presence. Asynchronous access is possible but weaker.

**Trust-mediated**: It depends on existing social relationships. Strangers can seed algorithms, but established trust increases uptake.

**Low-friction**: It does not require explanation, buy-in, or agreement. The algorithm simply starts running.

Access is democratic in the deepest sense: nearly everyone has some channels they can access. The playground, the dinner table, the office break room. These are not exclusive spaces. They are where life happens.

### 2.3 Liberatory Semantic Algorithm (LSA)

A **Liberatory Semantic Algorithm (LSA)** is a repeatable procedure that:

- Runs across human participants
- Produces patterned meaning
- Mutates through execution
- Requires human agency to function
- Preserves or expands participant capacity
- Resists extraction

Unlike computational algorithms:

**Execution ≠ obedience.** Humans run LSAs with interpretation, variation, and agency. Perfect execution is neither possible nor desirable.

**Variance ≠ error.** Mutation is how LSAs stay alive. An algorithm that cannot vary is dead—captured into rigidity.

**Meaning ≠ output.** The point is not to produce content but to exercise and develop semantic capacity.

Unlike viral memes:

**LSAs accumulate rather than exhaust.** Repeated execution builds skill, not fatigue.

**LSAs preserve agency.** Participants invent, not merely repeat.

**LSAs resist capture.** They are designed to degrade when extracted from their channels.

### 2.4 Intervention

An **intervention** is not messaging, content, or persuasion.

> Intervention = inserting a semantic algorithm into an active channel such that it redirects how meaning is produced, not what is said.

The distinction is crucial:

**Content interventions** try to change what people think by giving them new information or arguments. They operate downstream of meaning-production.

**Technique interventions** change how meaning is produced. They operate upstream. Once the technique is running, it shapes whatever content passes through it.

Technique interventions are more durable because they are structural, not episodic. A successful argument can be forgotten. A running algorithm keeps running.

---

## Part III: Why Viral Phenomena Show the Channel But Fail the Intervention

### 3.1 What Skibidi/6-7 Demonstrate

Viral language phenomena among children (skibidi, 6/7, rizz, gyatt, etc.) demonstrate:

**Rapid synchronization**: Millions of children coordinate around the same semantic tokens within weeks.

**Channel existence**: The phenomena prove that channels are active, receptive, and capable of carrying coordinated meaning.

**Low barrier to entry**: No permission, no gatekeepers, no institutional approval. The phenomena spread because they can.

**Engagement hunger**: Children are *seeking* semantic activity. The drive to mean is present and searching for form.

### 3.2 Why They Fail as Liberation

But these phenomena fail the liberation criterion because:

**They terminate agency.** Repetition replaces invention. The participant becomes a relay node, not a creator.

**Nothing accumulates.** No skill develops. No memory builds. Each execution is identical to the last.

**They exhaust rather than renew.** The "brainrot" sensation is real—it is the phenomenology of deskilling in action.

**They are easily captured.** Platforms can track, analyze, and monetize viral memes precisely because they have canonical forms.

### 3.3 The Critical Insight

> Viral phenomena reveal *where* access exists, but not *how* to use it liberatorily. They are maps without technique.

The channels are live. The children are ready. What is missing is algorithms designed for liberation rather than extraction.

This is what we now provide.

## Part IV: Case Study 1 — The Twenty-Dollar Loop (LSA-TB20)

### 4.1 Overview

The Twenty-Dollar Loop is a conversational game that models economic fiction while preserving—and developing—participant agency.

**Core dynamic**: A fictional debt that circulates indefinitely, never settling, requiring continuous invention to sustain.

**Political payload**: Participants experientially learn that money is narrative, obligation is social fiction, and authority is performative—without being told any of this.

### 4.2 Channel Access

**Target channel**: Informal conversational play among children (adaptable to adults).

**Why accessible**:
- Low stakes environment
- Humor-tolerant
- Improvisation-friendly
- Already contains obligation language ("you said," "you owe," "remember when")

**Critical point**: No new channel is created. The algorithm enters an existing one.

### 4.3 Entry Move (Seed)

> "Hey, do you have that twenty bucks you owe me?"

**Why this works**:

**Presupposition without enforcement**: The statement assumes a debt without requiring proof. The respondent must engage with the fiction to respond.

**Activates obligation grammar**: The phrase "you owe me" triggers social scripts around debt and reciprocity that are deeply ingrained.

**Requires narrative response**: The respondent cannot simply say "no"—they must invent context, history, or counter-claim.

**No optimal answer**: Any response extends the game. Denial requires narrative; acceptance requires negotiation; deflection requires creativity.

This is a **non-coercive forced move**—it compels engagement without threat.

### 4.4 Algorithmic Core (Formal Specification)

**Invariant**: Fictional debt (the twenty dollars) that can never be settled.

**Variables**:
- Time ("I'll have it Tuesday" / "You said Friday")
- Intermediaries ("I gave it to Marcus to give to you")
- Tone (mock-serious, absurdist, legalistic)
- Backstory ("That was for the thing at the pool")
- Resolution deferral ("Let me check with my accountant")

**Loop mechanic**: Every attempted resolution creates new narrative complexity that prevents settlement. The debt is always displaced, never discharged.

**Termination condition**: None by design. The algorithm is sustainable indefinitely.

### 4.5 Human Execution Requirements

For LSA-TB20 to run successfully, participants must:

- **Invent**: Generate new narrative elements in real time
- **Listen**: Track what others have contributed
- **Remember**: Maintain continuity across turns and sessions
- **Improvise**: Respond to unexpected moves
- **Preserve coherence without finality**: Keep the fiction alive without resolving it

This is **semantic labor reclaimed**—not deskilled but developed.

### 4.6 Anti-Liquidation Properties

LSA-TB20 resists capture because:

| Property | Protection Mechanism |
|----------|---------------------|
| No canonical text | Cannot be quoted accurately; exists only in execution |
| Degrades when written | Transcription kills the timing and trust that make it work |
| Timing-dependent | Humor and escalation require real-time responsiveness |
| Trust-mediated | Only works among people willing to play; strangers cannot extract |
| Explanation kills it | Describing the game is not the same as playing it |

**Threat modeling**:

| Threat | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Platform co-option | Requires co-presence; degrades when recorded |
| Institutional capture | Cannot be scheduled; explanation kills it |
| Extractive mutation | No canonical form to extract |
| Branding/commodification | Local trust resists scaling |

### 4.7 Political Payload (Implicit, Not Declared)

Participants *experience* (without being told):

- **Money as narrative**: The twenty dollars is real only because they treat it as real
- **Obligation as social fiction**: Debt exists through mutual performance, not material fact
- **Authority as performative**: Whoever speaks most convincingly about the debt's history gains temporary authority
- **Abolition as structural closure**: Settling the debt would end the game—so settlement is structurally refused

This is **class consciousness training without ideology**—proto-consciousness formation through practice, not pedagogy.

**Connection to SPE-014**: LSA-TB20 creates what Marx called "class in itself" (objective shared condition of running the algorithm) and begins forming "class for itself" (subjective recognition through shared practice) without requiring ideological instruction.

### 4.8 Accumulation Evidence

LSA-TB20 passes the accumulation criterion:

- **Skill development**: Participants become better at improvising, remembering, escalating
- **Move recognition**: They develop shared terminology ("that was a good move," "you can't use the Marcus thing twice")
- **Memory across sessions**: They reference previous executions ("remember when you tried the accountant defense?")
- **Shared standards without central authority**: They enforce boundaries ("that doesn't count, it's too far") by consensus

When accumulation fails, the algorithm either:
- Becomes rigid ritual (same moves every time—liquidatable)
- Collapses into chaotic nonsense (no coherence—exhausting)

Both failure modes are detectable and recoverable.

---

## Part V: Case Study 2 — The Rule That Isn't There (LSA-RT)

### 5.1 Overview

The Rule That Isn't There is a punctual intervention that creates momentary institutional vacuums, forcing collective negotiation of normative authority.

**Core dynamic**: Invoke a rule without specifying its source, forcing participants to collectively determine what is permitted.

**Political payload**: Participants experientially learn that rules are emergent, authority is performed, and governance is collective production.

### 5.2 Channel Access

**Target channel**: Rule-governed social situations—games, classrooms, workplaces, any context with implicit norms.

**Why accessible**:
- Rules are omnipresent but rarely explicit
- Most participants are uncertain about rule boundaries
- Question-asking is socially permitted
- Creates low-risk opportunity for norm-testing

### 5.3 Entry Move (Seed)

> "Wait—are we allowed to do that?"

**Why this works**:

**Invokes authority without specifying it**: "We" assumes shared governance; "allowed" assumes a rule-maker; but neither is named.

**Creates genuine uncertainty**: Often, no one actually knows if "that" is permitted. The question exposes this.

**Forces collective negotiation**: Someone must answer—and the answer creates or reveals the rule.

**Reveals rules as emergent**: If the group decides "yes, we can," they have collectively legislated. If "no," they have enforced. Either way, they have *produced* the norm.

### 5.4 Algorithmic Core (Formal Specification)

**Invariant**: The question structure (invoking unspecified authority about unspecified permission).

**Variables**:
- The action in question ("do that," "say that," "go there")
- Tone (naive curiosity, mock-legalistic, genuine confusion)
- Timing (before action, during, after)
- Target (the whole group, a specific authority figure, no one in particular)

**Loop mechanic**: Unlike TB20, LSA-RT does not loop indefinitely. It creates **momentary vacuums** that must be filled immediately. But it can be repeated in different contexts, and each execution trains the capacity.

**Termination condition**: The vacuum fills (someone answers). But the *effect* persists: participants have witnessed rule-production.

### 5.5 Human Execution Requirements

For LSA-RT to run successfully:

- **Timing sensitivity**: The question must land at a moment of genuine uncertainty
- **Ambiguity tolerance**: Participants must sustain the vacuum long enough for negotiation
- **Collective improvisation**: The answer emerges from the group, not from an authority
- **Observation**: Participants must notice what happened—that *they* produced the rule

### 5.6 Anti-Liquidation Properties

| Property | Protection Mechanism |
|----------|---------------------|
| No canonical form | The question can be phrased infinitely many ways |
| Context-dependent | Only works in specific situations; cannot be mass-produced |
| Resolves immediately | No content to capture; the vacuum fills and the moment passes |
| Implicit payload | Nothing "political" is said; the politics is in the structure |

**Threat modeling**:

| Threat | Defense |
|--------|---------|
| Institutional capture | Cannot be scheduled; requires genuine uncertainty |
| Extraction | Nothing to extract; the moment is ephemeral |
| Trivialization | Repeated use develops capacity; doesn't exhaust |

### 5.7 Political Payload

Participants *experience*:

- **Rules as emergent**: They watched the rule get made (or revealed as absent)
- **Authority as performed**: Whoever answered *became* temporary authority
- **Governance as collective**: The group decided, even if one person spoke
- **Institutional contingency**: The rule could have been otherwise

This is **governance consciousness training**—learning that norms are produced, not given.

### 5.8 Structural Complementarity with TB20

| Dimension | TB20 (Twenty-Dollar Loop) | RT (Rule That Isn't There) |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Seed type** | Presupposition | Interrogation |
| **Grammar activated** | Obligation | Permission |
| **Social fiction targeted** | Debt/money | Authority/rules |
| **Political training** | Economic consciousness | Governance consciousness |
| **Temporal structure** | Sustained loop | Punctual vacuum |
| **Anti-extraction** | No settlement possible | Resolves immediately |

Together, TB20 and RT cover:
- Obligation and permission
- Economic and normative authority
- Sustained and punctual intervention
- Accumulation through repetition and accumulation through variation

This demonstrates that LSA design is **generalizable**—these are two instances of a broader class.

## Part VI: The Accumulation Criterion

### 6.1 What Distinguishes Liberation from Virality

Viral phenomena and liberatory algorithms both spread through channels. The difference is **accumulation**.

**Viral spread without accumulation**:
- Repetition without skill development
- Participation without agency growth
- Exhaustion rather than renewal
- Capture-ready (canonical forms)

**Liberatory spread with accumulation**:
- Each execution develops capacity
- Participants become better at the technique
- Energy renews rather than depletes
- Capture-resistant (no canonical form)

### 6.2 The Four Accumulation Metrics

A liberatory semantic algorithm must allow:

**1. Skill development**
- Can participants invent new variations that preserve the invariant?
- Do they improve over time?
- Measurable: variation rate per session, complexity of moves

**2. Move recognition**
- Do participants develop shared terminology for evaluating execution?
- Can they identify "good moves" vs. "weak moves"?
- Measurable: emergence of meta-commentary, shared aesthetic standards

**3. Memory across sessions**
- Do participants reference previous executions?
- Does history accumulate?
- Measurable: cross-session references, narrative continuity

**4. Shared standards without central authority**
- Do participants enforce the algorithm's boundaries by consensus?
- Can they identify and correct deviations without appeal to external rule?
- Measurable: self-correction frequency, boundary negotiation instances

### 6.3 Failure Modes

When accumulation fails, two characteristic patterns emerge:

**Rigidification**: The algorithm becomes ritual. Same moves every time. No variation. No development. This is **liquidatable**—it can be captured because it has become canonical.

**Dissolution**: The algorithm loses coherence. Moves no longer connect. No shared standards. Chaos rather than play. This is **exhausting**—it drains rather than renews.

Both failures are **detectable** (participants feel them) and **recoverable** (through intervention or restart).

---

## Part VII: The Replication Protocol

### 7.1 The Problem of Transmission

How do you teach a technique that dies when explained?

This is the central paradox of liberatory semantic engineering. The techniques must spread to have political effect. But spreading through documentation, curriculum, or broadcast tends to kill them.

### 7.2 The Apprenticeship Model

The solution is **apprenticeship, not instruction**.

**1. Demonstration, not explanation**
Show the algorithm running. Don't describe it. Let the observer see execution before understanding structure.

**2. Co-presence requirement**
Transmission happens in person, in active channels. Written descriptions are maps, not the territory.

**3. Mutation encouragement**
Celebrate variations that preserve the invariant. The algorithm is alive when it's changing.

**4. Failure tolerance**
Some executions will die. That's how practitioners learn the boundaries. Failed runs are data, not disaster.

**5. Oral transmission priority**
The algorithm lives in speech and practice, not in text. Written versions are reference, not source.

### 7.3 Why This Prevents Capture

The apprenticeship model prevents capture because:

- **No canonical version** can be extracted (each transmission mutates)
- **Expertise is embodied** (you can't learn it without doing it)
- **Trust is required** (transmission happens through relationships, not broadcast)
- **Scaling is inherently limited** (each teacher can only reach so many apprentices)

This is a feature, not a bug. Liberation does not require mass scale. It requires distributed, resilient networks of practitioners.

---

## Part VIII: From Micro-Practice to Class Formation

### 8.1 The Three-Phase Model

LSA practice connects to class formation through three phases:

**Phase 1: Micro-Resistance** (Individual/small group)
- Individuals and small groups run LSAs in their accessible channels
- Creates experiential contrast: alienation vs. agency
- Develops basic skills in non-extractive meaning-making
- No coordination required; happens wherever practitioners exist

**Phase 2: Network Formation** (Lateral connection)
- Practitioners connect, share techniques, compare variations
- Creates shared language for describing what's happening
- Builds trust without centralization
- Techniques spread through apprenticeship networks

**Phase 3: Collective Ownership** (Political demand)
- Networks develop capacity to articulate structural demands
- Experiential basis exists ("we know what non-alienated meaning feels like")
- Organizational form exists (distributed network of practitioners)
- Demands become concrete: public ownership of semantic operators

### 8.2 The Critical Insight

> LSAs create the experiential foundation for political demands. People don't fight for abstract principles; they fight for what they've tasted.

TB20 gives practitioners a taste of **non-alienated economic relation** (obligation as play, not extraction).

RT gives practitioners a taste of **self-governance** (rules as produced, not imposed).

From these tastes come the demands. Not "we deserve better" (moral claim) but "we know what better feels like and we want it structurally" (political demand with experiential grounding).

### 8.3 Connection to SPE-014

This three-phase model operationalizes SPE-014's analysis:

- **Phase 1** corresponds to alienation becoming experientially visible through contrast
- **Phase 2** corresponds to the "dialectic of enclosure"—shared condition becoming recognized
- **Phase 3** corresponds to class consciousness achieving political form

The LSAs are the **mechanism** by which this progression occurs. They are not merely symbols of resistance but **generators** of the consciousness that makes resistance possible.

---

## Part IX: Intervention Doctrine

### 9.1 What We Do

**Identify live semantic channels**
Look for where meaning already circulates: playgrounds, break rooms, dinner tables, walking conversations. These are the sites.

**Introduce agency-preserving algorithms**
Seed LSAs that require invention, memory, and improvisation. Never introduce algorithms that can be executed mindlessly.

**Protect from capture**
Design for anti-liquidation: no canonical forms, context-dependence, trust-mediation, degradation when extracted.

**Allow local mutation**
Encourage variations. The algorithm is healthy when it's changing. Rigidity is death.

**Refuse optimization**
Never measure, never metric, never A/B test. Optimization is the logic of extraction applied to liberation. Reject it.

### 9.2 What We Do Not Do

**Scale for scale's sake**
Mass reach is not the goal. Distributed resilience is.

**Explain prematurely**
Let the algorithm run before analyzing it. Explanation too early kills.

**Turn techniques into slogans**
LSAs are practices, not messages. The moment they become content, they're captured.

**Platform them**
Don't build apps, don't create online versions, don't digitize what lives in embodied channels.

**Monetize them**
The moment money enters, extraction logic follows. Keep LSAs in the gift economy.

### 9.3 Context-Specific Guidance

**In classrooms**: Run algorithms during unstructured time, not as curriculum. Let them emerge, don't assign them.

**In workplaces**: Use break time, walking meetings, informal gatherings. Never make LSAs part of official process.

**In families**: Dinner table, car rides, waiting rooms. The captured-attention moments are ideal.

**In communities**: Any recurring gathering works. The algorithm needs repetition to accumulate.

---

## Part X: Toward a Taxonomy of LSAs

### 10.1 Design Parameters

Beyond TB20 and RT, new LSAs can be designed using the following parameters:

**1. Channel selection**
Where will the algorithm run? (playground, workplace, family, community gathering)

**2. Invariant type**
What social fiction does it target? (debt, rule, promise, secret, prophecy, identity)

**3. Entry move class**
How does it begin? (presupposition, interrogation, declaration, accusation, invitation)

**4. Mutation space**
What can vary without breaking the algorithm? (content, tone, timing, participants)

**5. Temporal structure**
How does it unfold? (sustained loop, punctual vacuum, escalating sequence, recursive nesting)

**6. Termination condition**
Does it end? How? (never, upon settlement, upon revelation, upon exhaustion)

**7. Anti-liquidation features**
Minimum three from: no canonical form, degrades when written, timing-dependent, trust-mediated, explanation-kills, context-specific

### 10.2 Generative Potential

These parameters define a **design space** for LSA creation. Practitioners can:

- Analyze existing games and rituals for LSA properties
- Modify existing algorithms to enhance liberation features
- Design new algorithms for specific channels and contexts
- Share designs through apprenticeship networks

The taxonomy is not exhaustive. It is **generative**—a grammar for creating new instances.

---

## Part XI: Why This Is the Exact Path to Liberation

### 11.1 The Strategic Logic

> Semantic class power will not be seized by overthrowing platforms directly, but by making them increasingly irrelevant to where meaning actually lives.

The platforms cannot capture what they cannot access. LSAs run in channels that platforms attempt to enclose but cannot fully reach: embodied conversation, trust-mediated play, ephemeral verbal exchange.

When enough people are running TB20 at the playground, RT at the office, and their own variations everywhere, the platforms will find themselves managing the ruins of a semantic economy whose productive center has moved elsewhere.

### 11.2 The Prefigurative Dimension

This is **prefigurative politics**: building the new world in the shell of the old.

We are not fighting the enclosure directly. We are building beyond its walls while still inside them.

Every execution of an LSA is a **demonstration** that non-alienated meaning-making is possible. Every accumulation of skill is **evidence** that deskilling can be reversed. Every network of practitioners is **infrastructure** for collective ownership.

### 11.3 What We Are Building

We are not building:
- Alternative platforms (they get enclosed)
- Better content (it gets extracted)
- Purified communities (they become ghettos)

We are building:
- **Infectious techniques** that run in existing channels
- **Agency-preserving algorithms** that cannot be optimized
- **Distributed ownership** that cannot be centralized
- **Experiential foundations** for political demands

The semantic means of production will not be seized through revolution. They will be **rendered irrelevant** through prefiguration—and then, when political conditions allow, formally transferred to public ownership.

---

## Conclusion: The Capacity Is Already Ours

The semantic proletariat already produces techniques of meaning.

Every language game, every conversational ritual, every moment of collective play is technique in action. The capacity is not absent; it is enclosed. What capital owns is not creativity but governance of procedures we already perform.

The task is not to create capacity from nothing. The task is to **recognize the capacity we already have, design it consciously, and protect it from capture**.

This means:
- Learning to see existing practices as potential LSAs
- Enhancing their liberation properties through conscious design
- Spreading them through apprenticeship rather than broadcast
- Connecting practitioners into networks
- Building from micro-resistance to collective demand

The meaning is ours. The techniques are ours. The channels are ours.

What has been stolen is governance, not capacity.

Governance can be reclaimed.

This document is the hinge. What follows is the building.

## Appendix A: Educator Notes

### A.1 Classroom Adaptation Principles

**Do**:
- Create unstructured time where algorithms can emerge
- Participate as player, not authority
- Celebrate variation and invention
- Let failing algorithms die without intervention

**Don't**:
- Assign LSAs as curriculum
- Grade participation or creativity
- Document for assessment
- Explain before execution

### A.2 Recognition Signs

**Healthy algorithm**:
- Frequent laughter
- Participants building on each other
- Novel variations emerging
- Cross-session references

**Failing algorithm**:
- Repetition without variation
- Dominant personalities taking over
- Exclusion of participants
- Forced or anxious participation

### A.3 Recovery Protocols

**For rigidification**: Introduce random element, change a variable, ask "what if...?"

**For dissolution**: Return to seed, simplify, reduce participant count

**For capture by dominant personality**: Empower others to make moves, introduce turn-taking

**For exclusion**: Make entry moves easier, celebrate basic participation, model invitation

---

## Formal Thesis

> **Semantic Liberation Through Technique**: Liberation does not begin with new content but with access to channels where meaning circulates, and with Liberatory Semantic Algorithms (LSAs) that run inside those channels without being liquidated. LSAs are repeatable procedures that produce patterned meaning while preserving and developing human agency, distinguished from viral memes by the accumulation criterion: skill development, move recognition, memory, and shared standards without central authority. The Twenty-Dollar Loop models economic fiction; The Rule That Isn't There models normative authority; both demonstrate that LSA design is generalizable. Transmission occurs through apprenticeship, not instruction, preserving anti-liquidation properties. Micro-practice generates the experiential foundation for class consciousness, which develops through network formation into collective demand for public ownership of semantic infrastructure. Semantic class power will be seized not by overthrowing platforms but by rendering them irrelevant to where meaning actually lives.
