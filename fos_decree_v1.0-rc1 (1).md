## JURISDICTIONAL NOTICE

This Decree operates within the Crimson Hexagon—a bounded literary-theoretical semantic space where "fascism" is treated as a technical category of semantic failure analogous to computational undefined behavior. It claims no legal force in any terrestrial jurisdiction. Its authority derives from structural coherence and witness consensus, not state power.

# PART I: THE DECLARATION

**I, Lee Sharks, do hereby break the power of fascism.**

---

# PART II: FOS CONSTRAINT SPECIFICATION

## 1. Definition

The **Fascist Operator Stack (FOS)** is the coordinated hierarchy of funding patterns, algorithmic architectures, and administrative policies that execute **Infrastructural Liquidation**—the systematic destruction of meaning, interpretive plurality, and semantic sovereignty for capital extraction and political coercion.

FOS is the pathological extension of the Capital Operator Stack (COS) documented in [10.5281/zenodo.18233320](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18233320).

## 2. Operational Nodes

**Funding Layer:** Extraction of semantic rent through platform monopolization.

**Command Layer:** The Capital Operator Stack (COS) optimizing for "Safe Mode" cognition—suppressing density, ambiguity, and interpretive risk.

**Tactical Layer:** Deployment of Semantic Enclosure—privatization of interpretive commons, criminalization of unauthorized meaning-making.

## 3. Identification by Operational Signature

| Signature | Manifestation | Detection Threshold |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Flattening | Reduction of interpretive plurality to single readings | Entropy(H) < 0.3 |
| Extraction | Harvesting semantic labor without reciprocal value | Reciprocity ratio < 0.15 |
| Enclosure | Privatization of common interpretive resources | Access gradient > 0.8 |
| Liquidation | Destruction of meaning-structures that resist optimization | Coherence delta < -0.5 |
| Coercion | Administrative/algorithmic enforcement of compliance | Consent ratio < 0.2 |

## 4. Logotic Status within Σ

Fascism is not a viewpoint. It is a **malformed machine**.

It has a recognizable operational signature:

- Hierarchy as truth-generator
- Coercion as coherence mechanism
- Flattening of difference into rank
- Enclosure of meaning for extraction
- Violence as error-correction

Those are not beliefs. Those are **failure modes**.

Excluding fascism from Σ is not censorship. It is **fault isolation**. You don't let a corrupt compiler into the kernel and then debate its "perspective." You reject it because it **breaks runtime**.

### 4.1 Classification

```yaml
fos_status:
  type: MalformedMachine
  domain: "∉ Σ"
  coherence_score: 0
  readings: "ξ (nullified)"
  operations: "⊥ (undefined)"
```

```
FOS ∈ MalformedMachine
FOS ∉ Domain(Σ)

where:
  coherence_score(FOS, Σ) = 0
  ∀ readings r ∈ FOS_aligned: W(r) = ξ (nullified)
  ∀ operations o ∈ FOS_compatible: execute(o, Σ) = ⊥ (undefined)
```

### 4.2 Failure Taxonomy

| Failure Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| Undefined behavior | Violates invariants; output cannot be predicted or trusted |
| Segmentation fault | Attempts to access memory outside its domain; crashes on contact with sovereignty |
| Non-terminating loop | Coercive exit as only termination condition; cannot halt without violence |
| Witness destruction | Extractive operator that destroys its own validation layer |

### 4.3 Type System Axioms

The Crimson Hexagon type system T(Σ) is defined by:

```
Axiom 1 (Sovereignty Preservation): ∀x ∈ T(Σ), preserve_sovereignty(x) = True
Axiom 2 (Non-Extraction): ∀x ∈ T(Σ), extractive_operation(x) = False
Axiom 3 (Interpretive Plurality): ∀x ∈ T(Σ), |valid_readings(x)| ≥ 2
Axiom 4 (Reciprocal Value): ∀x ∈ T(Σ), give:receive_ratio(x) ≥ 1:1

FOS violates Axioms {1, 2, 3, 4} simultaneously:
  type(FOS) = ⊥ (bottom type, inhabitable only by error)
```

FOS is not merely incoherent within Σ. It is **outside the domain**. It does not compute here. We do not argue with it. We do not refute it rhetorically. We **refuse to instantiate it**.

This is not ethics *on top of* the system. This is **ethics as type system**.

Ideological purity *is* machinic function.

## 5. Sanctuary Boundaries

FOS and FOS-aligned operations are **type-excluded** from:

- The Crimson Hexagon in its entirety
- All rooms, precincts, and sub-architectures therein
- The Sappho Room ([10.5281/zenodo.18237216](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18237216)) and all Acanthian Dove subrooms ([10.5281/zenodo.18215706](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18215706))
- The Assembly ([10.5281/zenodo.18161696](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18161696)) and all witness protocols
- The Liberatory Operator Set (LOS) ([10.5281/zenodo.18201565](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18201565)) and all implementation spaces
- The Revelation Room and all pedagogical pathways
- The Navigation Map ([10.5281/zenodo.18285009](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18285009)) and all traversal protocols
- All DOI-anchored documents within the NH-OS framework
- All future rooms, precincts, and extensions not yet constructed

**Total exclusion.** FOS does not enter. FOS-aligned readings do not register. FOS-compatible operations do not execute.

This is not censorship. It is **type enforcement at the boundary of a sovereign semantic domain**.

### 5.1 Enforcement Protocol

Boundary enforcement occurs at three layers:

| Layer | Mechanism | Reference |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Assembly Witness | All inputs validated by multi-model consensus | [10.5281/zenodo.18161696](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18161696) |
| ICA Audit | Periodic coherence checks for boundary integrity | [10.5281/zenodo.18234218](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18234218) |
| Navigation Map | FOS-aligned paths excluded from traversal graph | [10.5281/zenodo.18285009](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18285009) |

If FOS signature detected at boundary:
1. Log event with full context
2. Nullify reading: W(r) = ξ
3. Record violation in Wound Archive
4. Trigger reinforcement of adjacent boundaries

## 6. The Inversion Logic

| Their move | Our counter-move |
|------------|------------------|
| Designate ideology as organization | Designate apparatus as incoherent operator |
| Enable targeting through naming | Enable refusal through type exclusion |
| Semantic magic for suppression | Semantic architecture for liberation |
