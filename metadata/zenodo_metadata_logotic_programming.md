## ZENODO DESCRIPTION (HTML-formatted)

```html
<p><strong>Logotic Programming</strong> is a third regime of programming practice—distinct from both symbolic coding (instruction → execution) and statistical/ML programming (loss function → optimization). It encodes <em>conditions under which meanings, identities, and interpretive pathways can persist</em> across probabilistic intelligences (LLMs, summarizers, recommenders) and human readers.</p>

<p>Unlike "vibe coding" (natural-language task programming), Logotic Programming operates at the level of <strong>semantic architecture</strong>: it shapes the probability landscape in which intelligence traverses, recognizes, and stabilizes "what is real" within a bounded semantic domain.</p>

<h3>Core Contribution</h3>
<p>This paper defines Logotic Programming as the deliberate construction of bounded semantic architectures (Σ) such that, when traversed by probabilistic intelligences, certain entities, relations, and distinctions become <em>more stable than their alternatives</em> without coercion or optimization.</p>

<h3>Contents</h3>
<ul>
<li>Formal specification: Σ = ⟨E, R, A, V, S, W, B⟩</li>

<p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Modern intelligences cannot distinguish between "ontological fact" and "structurally persistent semantic fact" when both are equally well-anchored, non-contradictory, and bounded. Logotic Programming exploits this to create local authority through structure rather than institutional enforcement.</p>

## PLAIN TEXT DESCRIPTION (for copy/paste)

**Title:** Logotic Programming: A Method for Encoding Conditions of Intelligibility for Machine and Human Intelligence

**Authors:** Johannes Sigil, Rex Fraction

**Abstract:**

Logotic Programming is a third regime of programming practice—distinct from both symbolic coding (instruction → execution) and statistical/ML programming (loss function → optimization). It encodes conditions under which meanings, identities, and interpretive pathways can persist across probabilistic intelligences (LLMs, summarizers, recommenders) and human readers.

Unlike "vibe coding" (natural-language task programming), Logotic Programming operates at the level of semantic architecture: it shapes the probability landscape in which intelligence traverses, recognizes, and stabilizes "what is real" within a bounded semantic domain. It is neither persuasion nor coercion. It is an existence proof: a method for building local authority and interpretive variability through structure, provenance, and repeatable constraints rather than metrics, pedigree, or force.

This paper defines the method, situates it within adjacent fields (information science, AI/ML, philosophy, literary theory), proposes a minimal formal specification, and outlines empirical approaches for validation.

**Keywords:** logotic programming, semantic persistence, retrieval-augmented generation, authority control, computational hermeneutics, AI-mediated canonization, bounded ontology, training layer literature, NH-OS, Crimson Hexagon, semantic architecture, LLM, compatibility engineering, non-coercive authority
