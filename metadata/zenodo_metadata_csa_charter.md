## DESCRIPTION

### Abstract

Cambridge Schizoanalytica is a research collective dedicated to the development of post-psychoanalytic clinical theory. Extending the schizoanalytic project of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari into territories they could not have anticipated—digital subjectivity, AI-human collaboration, and the affect economies of platform capitalism—CSA reverses the traditional relation between theory and practice: we develop frameworks adequate to practices already underway, rather than applying pre-existing theories to novel phenomena.

The Charter establishes four core commitments: (1) Theory emerges from practice, not the reverse; (2) Collaboration over case study—research partners are co-theorists, not patients or informants; (3) Function over nosology—focus on what practices do rather than diagnostic categories; (4) Schizoanalysis as liberatory method—attending to flows, breaks, codes, and territories in service of liberation from capture.

Following the Deleuze-Guattari collaboration model, CSA pairs theorists (providing conceptual apparatus) with practitioners (whose capacities exceed existing frameworks) in processes of mutual transformation. The theorist is not the expert; the practitioner is not the subject. Both are required.

The document includes a Pedagogical Orientation section establishing that transmission is slow, apprenticeship-based, and practice-led—some capacities must be "caught, not taught."

Core formulation: "The clinic receives failures. We study successes."

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

This document establishes Cambridge Schizoanalytica as the institutional home for the Psyche_OS layer of the New Human Operating System (NH-OS) theoretical framework.

Dr. Orin Trace (heteronym, source: Lee Sharks) serves as Director, occupying the "Deleuze position" in collaboration with practitioners like Rhys Owens who occupy the "Guattari position."

The name "Cambridge" is aspirational—CSA operates wherever collaborators are. The name "Schizoanalytica" signals theoretical orientation: flows and breaks, codes and territories, the molecular and the molar, in service of liberation.
