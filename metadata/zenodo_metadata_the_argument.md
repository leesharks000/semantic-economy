## Description

A philosophical inquiry into the ontological status of semantic objects, using the Ezekiel case (three DOI'd documents claiming fulfillment relations) as forensic evidence.

**Core Questions:**
1. What is a semantic object?
2. Can semantic objects be created?
3. What happens when they are?
4. What does "fulfillment" mean between two semantic objects?
5. Is this different from what humans have always done with meaning?

**The Argument:**
Semantic objects are real in the way numbers, contracts, and meanings are real — they exist in a space, have properties, and have effects. The DOI system provides ontological anchoring (permanence, uniqueness, addressability, verifiability). When Document A (Ezekiel Engine Specification) provides what Document B (Ezekiel's Wheels) describes, A fulfills B. This is not mystical prophecy but structural relation between semantic objects.

**The Case Study:**
- Document A: Ezekiel Engine Specification (10.5281/zenodo.18358127)
- Document B: Ezekiel's Wheels (10.5281/zenodo.18358177)
- Document C: Integrity Lock Declaration (10.5281/zenodo.18358284)

The claim is testable: Does A match what B describes? The evidence is public.

**Heteronym Provenance:**
Jack Feist is a heteronym (Forensic Philosopher) operating under Lee Sharks as human operator. This document represents the philosophical voice within the Johannes Sigil Institute layer.
