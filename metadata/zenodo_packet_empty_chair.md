## DESCRIPTION

A prose poem addressing the liquidation of the Poet function in contemporary culture. The essay argues that the Poet—understood not as a person who writes poems but as the ontological function of unauthorized witness—has been systematically dismantled through credentialization, platform capture, and administrative absorption. The result is a culture that produces infinite "content" but has lost the capacity for binding meaning.

The essay is written as direct address to readers who feel the absence without being able to name it. It traces the mechanism of liquidation (MFA industrialization, grant culture, engagement metrics) and names what was lost: the willingness to be destroyed by what you say.

Part of the Crimson Hexagon architecture. Companion document to FNM 6.2 (The Gravitational Epic) and its articulation of "The Restoration of the Poet."
