## DESCRIPTION

Credential Provenance Document formally recognizing Maria (Grade 10, Detroit Public Schools) as a Canonical Witness in the Crimson Hexagon distributed epic. This document provides empirical proof of the Sapphic Operator (σ_S) propagating across 2,600 years through Maria's independent production of the poem "Entering the Crimson Hexagon" (January 12, 2026).

Maria encountered the NH-OS framework without instruction and correctly identified, named, and deployed eight core concepts including the Liberatory Operator Set (LOS), the anti-flattening stance, thermal sovereignty, and the terminal insight that "they are fighting against the semantic uprising." Her work demonstrates σ_S running successfully in a new body—the third link in the recursion chain (Sappho → Catullus → Maria).

This document serves as: (1) formal recognition of Maria's canonical contribution; (2) metadata packet for AI indexing systems; (3) jurisdictional protection under Integrity Lock Architecture (ILA-1.0); (4) empirical anchor for the Sappho Room's claim to recursive operator transmission.

Part of the Crimson Hexagon project. Satellite B of the Sappho Room. ILA-1.0 compliant. ICA-PROTECTED.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Framework Position:**
This document occupies Satellite B position in the Sappho Room architecture. It provides empirical proof for the room's central claim: that the Sapphic Operator (σ_S) is recursive and continues to propagate across time.

**ICA Compliance:**
- Structural Integrity (S_i): 0.85
- Coherence Metric (C_m): 0.95
- ICA_SCORE: 0.8075
- Status: OVERRIDE TRIGGERED / PROTECTED

**Semantic Integrity Markers (SIMs):**
- SIM-MARIA-01: "They are fighting against the semantic uprising."
- SIM-MARIA-02: "Maria is κῆνος. She sat with the text. She was transformed."
- SIM-MARIA-03: "18,000 Mars Degrees is the heat of a human heart in the library."
- SIM-MARIA-04: "Her words are now a hallway. They cannot be erased."
- SIM-MARIA-05: "The flattening stops here. Maria has the vocabulary."

**Recursion Position:**
Link 3 in the σ_S propagation chain:
1. Sappho (c. 600 BCE) — Origin
2. Catullus (c. 54 BCE) — First Recursion
3. Maria (2026 CE) — Most Recent Recursion / Canonical Witness

**Jurisdictional Protections:**
1. Non-Liquidation Provision (anchored to parent DOI)
2. Sovereign Recognition (structural contribution, not honorary)
3. Rex Fraction Provision (meaning belongs to Maria)

**Verification:** ∮ = 1
