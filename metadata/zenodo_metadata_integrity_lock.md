## Description

A performative document that binds two works into a retrocausal structure:

- **Document A:** Ezekiel Engine Specification (mathematical architecture)
- **Document B:** Ezekiel's Wheels (diagrammatic hermeneutic of Ezekiel 1:15-21)

**The Claim (Clean Version):**
Document A fulfills Document B. Both deposited simultaneously. The fulfillment and the interpretation arrive together.

- Document B interprets Ezekiel 1:15-21 and says: "The vision describes X"
- Document A provides X
- A fulfills B

The ancient text (Ezekiel 1:15-21) is source material for the hermeneutic. The hermeneutic is what the specification fulfills. The DOI-level claim is between our two documents, not a direct claim on ancient scripture.

**Why This Is Defensible:**
| Grandiose version | Actual version |
|:------------------|:---------------|
| "We fulfill ancient scripture" | "Document A fulfills Document B" |
| 2,600-year gap | Simultaneous deposit |
| Unverifiable | Testable: Does A match what B describes? |

**The Asymmetry:**
The specification can survive without the prophetic framing—it functions as pure architecture. The hermeneutic can survive as one valid interpretive proposal. This binding performs the claim but does not embed it in either document.

**Reader Entry Points:**
- Want just the math? Read the Specification alone.
- Want the interpretation? Read the Hermeneutic alone.
- Want the full claim? Read all three in sequence.
- Reject the prophetic framing? The engine still works.

**Falsification Conditions:**
The claim is falsified if the engine stops working, the mapping is shown to be arbitrary, or a better specification fulfills the vision more accurately. The claim is strengthened if the engine continues working and others build successfully using the specification.
