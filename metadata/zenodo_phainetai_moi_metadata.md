## Description

This article proposes a new reading of Sappho Fragment 31 (Voigt) based on reassessment of deictic structure and colour semantics. The argument proceeds through four claims:

**1. κῆνος as Future Reader**

The distal demonstrative κῆνος ("that man") in line 1 points not to a present rival but to a future reader—the one who will sit "face-to-face" (ἐνάντιος) with the inscribed text. He is "equal to the gods" (ἴσος θεοῖσιν) because he achieves what should be impossible: presence with the dead.

**2. The Second Person as Archived Self**

The second-person addressee (τοι, σ') is identified not with a beloved woman but with the poem itself—Sappho-as-inscribed. The speaker addresses her future archived self. The physiological symptoms are triggered by this imaginative projection: she sees herself being read.

**3. The Somatic Catalogue as Media Transition**

The progression of bodily failures—voice, tongue, skin, sight, hearing, motor control, colour—traces not jealous collapse but systematic dematerialization: the staged withdrawal of everything that constitutes embodied presence, until only the inscribable remains.

**4. χλωρός as Papyrus Transformation**

The simile χλωροτέρα ποίας ("greener/paler than grass") figures the speaker's transformation into papyrus substrate. The χλωρός spectrum (green → grey) traces the colour of papyrus in preparation for inscription. The body becomes the book.

**5. Reconstruction of the Lost Fourth Stanza**

A new reconstruction completes the poem's logic:

```
ἀλλὰ πᾶν τόλματον· ἐπεί σε, Κύπρι,
καὶ πένητά γε κἄ βασιλῆα δάμασσε·
καὶ πόλεις ὀλβίους ἀπέθηκας ἄφαντον·
    γράμμασι μολπὰν
```

"But all must be dared; for you, Kypris, have yoked beggar and king alike, and you have cast down even prosperous cities to nothing—let the song survive in letters."

The Adonic γράμμασι μολπὰν completes what the preceding stanzas began. The poem ends not in prayer or resignation but in the act it has been performing all along: inscription.

**Conclusion**

Fragment 31 emerges as the foundational text of lyric self-archiving—a meditation on how voice outlasts the body that speaks it. Catullus 51 is not imitation but instantiation: Catullus IS κῆνος, the future reader the poem anticipated. The circuit completes in every reading.

## Abstract

This article proposes a new reading of Sappho Fragment 31 (Voigt) based on reassessment of deictic structure and colour semantics. I argue that the distal demonstrative κῆνος (line 1) points not to a present rival but to a future reader—the one who will sit 'face-to-face' (ἐνάντιος) with the inscribed text. The poem's somatic catalogue describes the phenomenology of voice becoming text, while the χλωρός simile figures the speaker's transformation into papyrus substrate. A new reconstruction of the lost fourth stanza completes this reading: the poem ends with an imperative that song survive 'in letters' (γράμμασι). Fragment 31 thus emerges as the foundational text of lyric self-archiving—a meditation on how voice outlasts the body that speaks it.

## Relation to NH-OS Architecture

This article provides the philological foundation for claims made in the Sappho Provenance Node (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18202475). While the Provenance Node integrates the κῆνος reading into the broader NH-OS framework, this article presents the argument in standalone scholarly form suitable for peer review.

**Key theoretical contributions to NH-OS:**

| Article Claim | NH-OS Concept |
|---------------|---------------|
| κῆνος = future reader | Retrocausal canon formation |
| Somatic catalogue = media transition | Graceful degradation (D_pres) |
| χλωρός = papyrus transformation | Substrate transition |
| γράμμασι μολπὰν = inscription imperative | Thermal sovereignty through text |
| Catullus as instantiation | C_RETRO (retrocausal confirmation) |

**The article can stand alone as classical scholarship. Its integration into NH-OS is additive, not constitutive.**

## Notes

**On the Reconstruction:**

The proposed fourth stanza (γράμμασι μολπὰν) is speculative, as all reconstructions of lost stanzas must be. However, it satisfies multiple constraints:

1. Resumes ἀλλὰ πᾶν τόλματον (attested)
2. Accounts for Catullus' "reges...et beatas urbes"
3. Employs Sapphic diction (γράμματα + μολπά attested in fr. 44.33, fr. 147)
4. Scans as Sapphic stanza (hendecasyllables + Adonic)
5. Completes the poem's trajectory from embodiment to inscription

Future papyrological discoveries may confirm, modify, or refute this reconstruction. Until then, it stands as hypothesis.

**On Scholarly Independence:**

This article does not require acceptance of the broader NH-OS framework. The argument proceeds from:
- Standard philological methods (deictic analysis, lexical semantics)
- Established scholarship (Bonifazi, D'Alessio, Svenbro)
- Internal evidence from the text and its reception (Catullus 51)

Readers may accept the κῆνος-as-future-reader thesis while remaining agnostic about the Semantic Economy, the Crimson Hexagon, or other NH-OS constructs.

## Abstract (Short)

Fragment 31 is not about jealousy—it is about lyric transmission. κῆνος ("that man") points to the future reader; χλωροτέρα ποίας figures transformation into papyrus; the reconstructed fourth stanza ends γράμμασι μολπὰν ("let the song survive in letters"). Catullus 51 proves the reading works: he IS κῆνος, the reader the poem anticipated. The foundational text of lyric self-archiving.
