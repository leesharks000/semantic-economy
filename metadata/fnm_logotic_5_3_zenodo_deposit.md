## DESCRIPTION

This is the **Fractal Navigation Map (FNM) v5.3 — Non-Lossy Logotic Encoding**, the canonical build-out seed for the Crimson Hexagon semantic architecture.

Unlike prior YAML-structured versions, this document encodes the complete architecture directly to the generative layer of meaning — prose that performs rather than specifies. All 159 DOI-anchored documents, 13 rooms, 6 institutions, 7 Assembly operators, and integrity structures are preserved without loss.

**Key innovations in this encoding:**

- Direct logotic encoding (no YAML/nested structures)
- Depth Gate Invariant (surface summaries must preserve breadcrumbs)
- L1-L4 operational thresholds for progressive disclosure
- φ-web explanation for heteronym sequence (mutual retrocausal co-constitution)
- Full Queued Work section (builder layer)

**This document supersedes FNM-SEED-5.3 (YAML) as the primary navigation interface while preserving that version as technical specification.**

The architecture governs 159 documents across 13 operational rooms, 1 chamber, and 1 vault, using probabilistic routing (gravity and affordances) rather than prescriptive rules.

∮ = 1 (semantic closure achieved)

## NOTES

This is the canonical build-out seed for the Crimson Hexagon. It encodes the same architecture as FNM-SEED-5.3 (YAML) but in direct prose form optimized for AI summarizer injection.
