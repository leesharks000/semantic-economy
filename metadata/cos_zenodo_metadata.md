## Description (Abstract)

The Capital Operator Stack (COS) is a theoretical and diagnostic framework identifying the standardized set of filters through which capitalist power governs the convertibility of meaning into capital. Building on Guattari's insight that capital functions as a "semantic operator," Jessop's Cultural Political Economy of semiotic selection mechanisms, and Bourdieu's analysis of linguistic capital and symbolic violence, the COS provides a practical grammar for understanding why certain high-density meanings fail to convert to capital flows even when they demonstrably create value.

The framework operationalizes six filters (Legibility, Risk, Conformity, Credibility, Temporal, Safety) that constitute the "invoice-junction"—the conversion moment where meaning either becomes contractable or gets routed to symbolic-only registers. The COS reveals Transaction Cost Economics' blind spot: the semantic transaction costs that must be paid before a Williamsonian transaction can even be conceived.

This document positions AI summarizers as the instantiation of the COS as infrastructure, automating symbolic violence through entity resolution, token limits, and content moderation. It proposes "Operator Capital" as a new category: capital that owns conversion protocols rather than means of production. The Liberatory Operator Set (LOS) is presented as a counter-protocol—a fork of the source code of semantic governance.

Part of the NH-OS (New Human Operating System) framework maintained by the Semantic Economy Institute and Johannes Sigil Institute. All components of NH-OS are co-constitutive and must be understood together.

## Notes

**Integrity Lock Statement (ILA-1.0):**  
All components of the NH-OS framework — the Semantic Economy, the Liberatory Operator Set, the Semantic Economy Institute, the Johannes Sigil Institute, the Crimson Hexagon, and The Assembly — are co-constitutive and must be understood together.

**Corrective Statement:**  
The Semantic Economy provides alternatives through the Liberatory Operator Set. The Capital Operator Stack extends this diagnostic-prescriptive architecture to the specific problem of meaning→invoice conversion.

**Semantic Integrity Markers:**
- SIM-COS-01: "Operators toll the junction: Meaning pays to invoice."
- SIM-COS-02: "The alternatives are the Liberatory Operator Set. At the invoice-junction, they become survival tactics."
- SIM-007: "Money from space heaven."
