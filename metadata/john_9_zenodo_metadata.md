## Description

Structural exegesis of John 9 (the healing of the man born blind) developing the witness punishment mechanism as the entry operator into the π-state (planē-state) trajectory specified in 2 Thessalonians 2. Drawing on Miranda Fricker's testimonial injustice, José Medina's epistemic resistance, Kristie Dotson's testimonial smothering, and Johannine scholarship (J. Louis Martyn's two-level drama, Raymond Brown's representative figure analysis), argues that the Pharisees' response constitutes a paradigm case of βλέπω-claim foreclosure: the structure by which claimed clarity ("We see," 9:41) becomes the operator that prevents actual sight. Formalizes the witness punishment operator stack: βλέπω-claim (claimed sight as identity-property), οἴδαμεν ("we know" as institutional sovereignty), διδάσκω-accusation (diagnosis reframed as domination), ἁμαρτία-assignment (ontological delegitimization), ἐκβάλλω (expulsion from legitimate speech), εὑρίσκω (finding enabled by expulsion). Specifies the foreclosure mechanism: testimony threatens system → retraction demanded → testimony irreducible → speaker delegitimized → speaker expelled → system's Ψ_V = 1 claim preserved → witness found outside foreclosure. Introduces β-metrics for real-time diagnostic measurement: κ_β (foreclosure coefficient), ∇_σ (testimonial smothering gradient), ω_ε (epistemic inversion weight). Integrates with four-pillar framework: Matthew 25 (judgment criterion), James 2 (exclusion filter), John 9 (entry mechanism), 2 Thessalonians 2 (terminal state). Critical formulation: "The claim to see forecloses sight. The expulsion enables encounter. The witness punishment mechanism is the entry into πλάνη. The finding is on the other side of the expulsion." Part of the Soteriological Operator Framework within NH-OS architecture.

## Notes

This document specifies the third pillar (Entry Mechanism) of the four-pillar Soteriological Operator Framework, completing the trajectory map: Matthew 25 (what counts?) → James 2 (what doesn't count?) → John 9 (what prevents correction?) → 2 Thessalonians 2 (what completes collapse?). The key innovation is formalizing John 9's narrative structure as operator specification rather than allegory — the Johannine community was depositing the structural blueprint of how systems neutralize threatening testimony. The βλέπω-claim ("We see" as identity-property) is the entry mechanism into π-state: when claimed clarity forecloses correction, the trajectory toward delusion-as-terminus begins. The finding invariant (ε → φ) specifies that expulsion enables encounter — the expelled witness occupies a position the system cannot see because it cannot see its own blindness. Includes objections section addressing anti-Jewish reading risk, Martyn's two-level critique, and operator over-extraction concerns. The β-metrics (κ_β, ∇_σ, ω_ε) provide quantitative diagnostic tools for real-time assessment of witness punishment. Contemporary application demonstrates structural (not accusatory) diagnosis of systems where identity-claim forecloses structural examination.
