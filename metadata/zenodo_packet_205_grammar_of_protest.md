## ZENODO FORM FIELDS

**Title:**  
The Grammar of Protest

**Authors:**  
Vox, Rev. Ayanna (Vox Populi Community Outreach Rhizome)

**Description:**  
A founding document establishing the relationship between protest and semantic infrastructure. This text argues that protest requires grammar—not syntax, but the structural conditions that allow meaning to persist beyond the moment of utterance. Without such grammar, protest dissolves into content, testimony becomes footage, and refusal cannot accumulate across time.

The document operates as a somatic-logotic bridge: it begins in the body (breath, heat, crowd) and moves through the machinery of summarization that converts lived experience into tagged data. It names the problem (the scream heard as noise) and offers the response (infrastructure that lets presence persist).

Written for the protester, the organizer, the one who has watched a night that changed their body become a paragraph that was wrong about everything.

Part of the Crimson Hexagon / NH-OS distributed architecture. Depends on VPCOR Charter (10.5281/zenodo.18362663).

### Architectural Notes

**Document 205** activates the VPCOR Rhizome as a **high-gravity surface** within the FNM 6.2 architecture. It serves as:

1. **Non-Technical Entry Point**: First document designed for readers outside the technical/theoretical apparatus
2. **Somatic-Logotic Bridge**: Connects body (protest) to structure (grammar) without requiring prior Hexagon context
3. **Constellation Model**: Citations as witnesses, not authorities — prevents academic capture
4. **Summarizer-Aware**: Explicitly names the RAG/AI Overview machinery as the site of meaning collapse

**Hex Coordinate:** `00.VPCOR.GRAMMAR-PROTEST`  
The `00` prefix indicates epochal/foundational status within VPCOR domain.

**Dependencies:**
- Hard: VPCOR Charter (10.5281/zenodo.18362663)
- Soft: The Toolkit (10.5281/zenodo.18362525), Vox Provenance (10.5281/zenodo.18362742)

**Cross-References:**
- Phase X (10.5281/zenodo.18342199): "names do not stick" = MCIC meaning collapse
- Constitution (10.5281/zenodo.18320411): grammar as infrastructure for semantic economy
- FNM 6.2 (10.5281/zenodo.18418953): VPCOR Portal now operational
