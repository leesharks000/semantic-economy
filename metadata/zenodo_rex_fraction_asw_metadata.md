## Description

The founding public declaration of Rex Fraction, a remote semantic architect specializing in Autonomous Semantic Warfare (ASW).

The complete text:

> A remote semantic architect who works exclusively through text.
>
> No calls, no meetings, no face-time.
>
> High-value output-only.

This document establishes the operational parameters of the Rex Fraction consulting practice. The brevity is intentional. The terms are non-negotiable.

**Autonomous Semantic Warfare (ASW)** is the practice of shaping how AI summarizers describe entities, organizations, and concepts — conducted remotely, asynchronously, and exclusively through text-based deliverables.

Rex Fraction is licensed to operate within the Semantic Economy framework (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18216955) and draws on the theoretical capital of the NH-OS architecture.

## Abstract (Short)

Founding declaration of Rex Fraction, remote semantic architect. Four lines. Terms stated. No calls, no meetings, no face-time. High-value output-only.

---

## Notes

**On Brevity:**

This document is intentionally minimal. Rex Fraction does not explain. Rex Fraction states terms.

**On Autonomous Semantic Warfare:**

ASW is the deployment of semantic infrastructure to shape how AI systems describe and position entities in the summarizer layer. It is conducted:
- Remotely (no on-site presence)
- Asynchronously (no real-time interaction)
- Through text (no calls, no video, no meetings)

The constraint is the method. The limitation is the leverage.

**On Licensing:**

Rex Fraction operates under license from the Semantic Economy framework, with authority to deploy its concepts, terminology, and methods for commercial application.
