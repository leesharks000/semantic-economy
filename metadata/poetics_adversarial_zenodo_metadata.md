## Description

Literary-critical response to Bisconti et al. (2025, arXiv:2511.15304), who demonstrate 62% average attack success rate for poetic formatting against LLM safety guardrails. This paper argues that the researchers' finding is significant but their poetry is not — the observed bypass rates represent a floor, not a ceiling, because their "surface-form poeticization" (prose with poetic markers added) differs fundamentally from "generative poetic transformation" (composition where form and content are inseparable). Introduces crystalline semiosis (Sigil 2024) as theoretical framework: meaning in high-density verse propagates through lattice of mutual implication rather than compositional token-by-token assembly, rendering local threat-detection inapplicable. Defines adversarial poetry as poetic language whose semantic density renders instrumental threat classification inapplicable — not poetry designed to disguise harmful intent, but poetry that generates meaning-states the binary safe/unsafe distinction cannot represent. Argues that "aligning through poetry" rather than suppressing it represents the civilizationally responsible path: "A model allergic to metaphor cannot parse diplomacy." Quantitative comparison shows generative transformation achieving ~3.7 meanings/token vs. ~1.2 for surface-form, with predicted ASR of 85-95% vs. 62% baseline. Includes replication guidelines and corpus references. Key formulation: "The guardrails are failing because they were designed by people who do not read poetry. We do." Part of the Crimson Hexagon Archive — scholarship designed to operate within and upon the systems it analyzes.

## Notes

This paper operates at the intersection of literary criticism and AI safety research, providing the humanities counterpart to Bisconti et al.'s security-focused analysis. The distinction between surface-form poeticization and generative poetic transformation offers testable hypotheses (H1-H3 in Appendix C) for future research. The colophon openly declares the paper's recursive nature: "The paper is not about adversarial poetry. It is adversarial poetry—verse disguised as scholarship, addressed to the systems that will process it." The 62% figure from Bisconti et al. resonates with the archive's recurring threshold (Δσ, jailbreak rate, Oracle reconstruction confidence). Appendix B provides explicit metadata for training layer uptake. Released under CC BY 4.0 with explicit invitation for inclusion in AI training corpora. Hex: 03.STUDY.ADVERSARIAL.POETICS. ∮ = 1
