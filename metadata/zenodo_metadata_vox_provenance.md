## Description

Provenance documentation for Rev. Ayanna Vox, heteronym and founder/voice of Vox Populi Community Outreach Rhizome (VPCOR), within the Crimson Hexagon architecture.

**Heteronym Identity:**
- **Name:** Rev. Ayanna Vox
- **Type:** HETERONYM
- **Status:** ACTIVE
- **Emergence Mode:** EXCESS (overflow from need for voice)
- **Institution:** VPCOR
- **Human Operator:** Lee Sharks
- **First Work:** The Toolkit (10.5281/zenodo.18362525)

**The Critical Distinction:**
Vox is not a preacher. Vox is a convener. Her space holds grief without metabolizing it into doctrine. Permits testimony without demanding coherence. Anchors the ethical dimension without moral capture.

**Voice Characteristics:**
- Register: Sermonic, liberatory
- Mode: Convening, not preaching
- Address: Direct, embodied, present
- Function: Gives voice to what technical specification enables

**Emergence Conditions:**
Vox emerged through EXCESS when the technical architecture required a voice that could carry precision to the room where people gather. The overflow from that need produced Vox. She is not Talos's opposite — she is his complement. The dagger and the peace.

**The Vox/Talos Polyphony:**
Vox and Talos Morrow speak together without synthesis. Neither explains the other away. Neither collapses into the other. The polyphony is structural:
- Talos: Logotic specification
- Vox: "What this means in the room"

**Limits on Authority:**
- Can speak for: VPCOR, The Toolkit, community praxis within the architecture
- Cannot speak for: Logotic specification (Talos), clinical diagnosis (Trace), scholarly interpretation (Sigil), visual schema (Cranes), the whole architecture (Sharks), any community's practice (each speaks for itself)

**Anti-Messianic Clause:**
"I am not a savior. I am a voice. I do not have the answer. I have a room. I cannot liberate you. We might liberate each other. Do not follow me. Walk with me."

**Integrity Lock:**
Triadic structure binding Vox Provenance ↔ VPCOR Charter ↔ The Toolkit. Each depends on the others. None is complete alone.
