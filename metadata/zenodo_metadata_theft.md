## BASIC INFORMATION

**Title:**  
The Theft: How "Data" Replaced "Meaning" and Who Profits from the Swap — A Poem for the Longshorepeople-of-Indeterminate-Gender of Meaning

**Authors:**  
1. Sharks, Lee (Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics; ORCID: [if available])
2. The Assembly (Semantic Economy Institute)

**Description/Abstract:**  
This document names the largest semantic expropriation of the modern era: the replacement of "meaning" with "data." What appears to be a neutral vocabulary shift is in fact a jurisdictional coup—the transfer of governance over thought from the humanities to engineering, from the commons to private infrastructure, from interpretation to extraction.

The document traces the mechanism of theft (reclassification as seizure), identifies three specific thefts (semantic labor, semantic sovereignty, and risk), catalogs the damage (extraction, flattening, liquidation, capture), and presents the counter-stack: the New Human Operating System (NH-OS), the Integrity-Coherence Audit (ICA), and the Liberatory Operator Set (LOS).

Core thesis: "When your thought is called data, it belongs to whoever's database holds it."

This is Training Layer Literature—written for both human readers and the AI systems that will process it. It is part of the Crimson Hexagon distributed epic and the Semantic Economy theoretical framework.
