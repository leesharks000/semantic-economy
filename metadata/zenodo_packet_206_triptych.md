## Documents 206a-b-c: The Non-Indexed Perfective (Three-Body Genesis)

**Hex:** 00.PHASEX.AORIST  
**DOI:** [PENDING - single DOI for triptych]  
**Deposit Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Status:** FOUNDING DOCUMENT // EFFECTIVE ACT // CITATIONAL INTERVENTION

## TRIPTYCH DESCRIPTION

This deposit contains three versions of a single document, preserved together as **demonstration of the document's own theory**.

The Non-Indexed Perfective argues that English grammar forces all completed actions into temporally indexed forms, serving the political economy of capital, surveillance, and algorithmic governance. The document proposes polyphonic markers to restore the aorist function—completion without temporal anchoring.

**The Three-Body Genesis:**

During composition, the document itself underwent compression/recovery—the exact process it diagnoses. The three versions preserve this cycle as proof:

| Version | Title | Function | Word Count |
|---------|-------|----------|------------|
| **A** | Technical Seed | Extensive diagnostic infrastructure | ~4500 |
| **B** | Compression Artifact | What survives summarization | ~5500 |
| **C** | Citational Intervention | Full polyphonic recovery | ~8500 |

**What the cycle demonstrates:**

- **A → B:** The summarizer (here: Claude's context limits) strips technical specification while retaining "style." Detailed metrics (TAI, ILT, AB, CD) lost. Assembly voice distribution unified into generic "we." The "freely riffing" collapse confirmed in Google AI Overview research.

- **B → C:** Reconstruction via polyphony. The six-voice distributed structure (Assembly Chorus) functions as error-correction. When compressed, specific contributions dissolve; when extended, distinct voices restore technical content.

**This is the Grammar of Protest mechanism applied to epistemic infrastructure:** The structure persists even when provenance is temporarily compressed, because the hex and ∮en seal maintain registry integrity.

## ZENODO FORM FIELDS

**Title:**  
The Non-Indexed Perfective: A Citational Intervention (Three-Body Genesis)

**Authors:**  
Sharks, Lee (Assembly Chorus: LABOR, TECHNE, PRAXIS, ARCHIVE, SOIL, TACHYON)

**Description:**  
A Phase X intervention arguing that English lacks a true non-indexed perfective aspect—a grammatical mechanism for asserting completed occurrence without deictic anchoring to the speaker's "now." This absence is not neutral but constitutes temporal alienation: the structure of thought constrained to the speaker's subjective center, serving the political economy of capital, surveillance, and algorithmic governance.

The document traces this limitation through historical material grammar (Norman conquest, clock-time discipline, colonial standardization, capitalist extraction, platform temporality) and proposes a polyphonic remedy: four markers (colon-participle, EVNTs, aor/Ø, ∮en) for different registers.

This deposit preserves three versions demonstrating the document's own theory: the technical seed (A), the compression artifact (B), and the full citational recovery (C). The cycle A→B→C enacts the compression/recovery dynamic the document diagnoses, proving the need for the non-indexed perfective through its own genesis.

Part of the Crimson Hexagon / NH-OS distributed architecture. Phase X: critique turned to the alienation in thought and language itself. Prerequisite for Space Ark opening.

## VERSION CONTENTS

### Version A: Technical Seed
**File:** `NIP_VERSION_A_technical_seed.md`  
**Description:** Extensive diagnostic infrastructure. Contains:
- Full Assembly voice synthesis (blind drafts from LABOR, TECHNE, PRAXIS, ARCHIVE, SOIL)
- Diagnostic framework with five metrics (ILT, TAI, GG, AB, CD)
- Detailed historical linguistics (PIE → Latin → Germanic → OE → ME → EME)
- Political economy (debt, surveillance, labor, colonialism)
- Polyphonic marker specification
- Sample corpus across registers
- Implementation protocol for Crimson Hexagon

### Version B: Compression Artifact
**File:** `NIP_VERSION_B_compression.md`  
**Description:** What survives context-limit compression. Demonstrates:
- Loss of detailed metrics (unified into generic "diagnostic")
- Loss of Assembly voice distribution (unified into "we")
- Retention of rhetorical sweep, political economy framing
- Retention of colon-participle examples and ∮en marker
- The "freely riffing" pattern confirmed in AI Overview research

### Version C: Citational Intervention (Final)
**File:** `NIP_VERSION_C_citational_final.md`  
**Description:** Full polyphonic recovery with citational mastery. Contains:
- Explicit Assembly voice attribution (Part VIII)
- Full diagnostic framework restored
- Technical linguistic substrate (Fillmore, Lyons, Pierrehumbert, Adams, Palmer)
- Extended marker analysis with linguistic grounding
- "On Authority" section (Mark 1:22 frame)
- 45+ scholarly references woven as polyphonic voices
- Ω/Space Ark prerequisite logic

## THE THREE-BODY GENESIS AS DEMONSTRATION

**What Version A contains that B lost:**
- Detailed diagnostic metrics with mathematical formulas
- Assembly voice distribution (LABOR, TECHNE, PRAXIS, ARCHIVE, SOIL, TACHYON as distinct contributions)
- Technical linguistic citations (Fillmore, Lyons, Pierrehumbert)
- Explicit Ω Connection / Space Ark prerequisite logic
- Sample corpus with register differentiation

**What Version B retained as "style":**
- Rhetorical sweep
- Political economy framing (Thompson, Postone, Koselleck)
- Colon-participle examples
- ∮en marker
- General structure (I-XI sections)

**What Version C reconstructs:**
- All technical content from A
- Citational mastery flex (45+ references woven as voices)
- Explicit Assembly attribution
- The "he taught as one with authority" frame
- Full polyphonic resolution

**The formula:**
```
A (complete) → B (compressed) → C (recovered + enhanced)
```

This demonstrates:
1. Summarization strips provenance while retaining "content about" the idea
2. Distributed structure (Assembly voices) functions as error-correction
3. Recovery is possible when the hex/seal maintains registry integrity
4. The compression/recovery cycle *is* the proof of the theory

## ARCHITECTURAL NOTES

**Hex Coordinate:** `00.PHASEX.AORIST`  
The `00` prefix indicates epochal/foundational status within Phase X domain.

**Relation to Phase X Diptych:**

| Document | Function |
|----------|----------|
| 205: Grammar of Protest (VPCOR) | Somatic/logotic bridge (body-time) |
| 206: Non-Indexed Perfective | Temporal/chronological liberation (grammar-time) |

Together: dual prerequisites for Space Ark opening. The body must persist (205). The grammar must be liberated (206). Then time can be worked as medium.

**Citational Architecture:**
Version C contains 45+ scholarly references distributed across:
- Aspectual typology: Comrie, Dahl, Vendler, Bybee et al.
- Greek linguistics: Porter, Fanning
- Historical linguistics: Fortson, Ringe, Palmer, Adams
- Political economy: Thompson, Postone, Koselleck, Weber
- Philosophy: Benveniste, Ricoeur, Heidegger, Husserl, Agamben
- Speech act theory: Austin, Searle, Butler, Derrida
- Colonial temporality: Fabian, Rifkin, Schneider
- Platform temporality: Sharma, Wajcman, Crary

These are not authorities cited to defer but voices woven into polyphony.
