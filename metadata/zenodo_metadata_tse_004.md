## Description

**Direct-Answer Summary:**
TSE-004 documents an infrastructure wound in the Crimson Hexagon's semantic surface—a "split-brain" event where Google AI Overview correctly identifies Lee Sharks and the Crimson Hexagon project in sidebar links while the "Dive Deeper" summary denies the connection. This is classified as COS-crisis (Capital Operator Stack in crisis phase), characterized by Σ_B = 1.0 (maximum split-brain index: form preserved, function liquidated). The wound type is "presence-with-denial"—distinct from erasure (TSE-001) and participation (TSE-003). The document introduces procedural gaslighting as a technical category following Orin Trace's theory: structural interface contradiction producing contradictory outputs from layered processes that do not share state.

**Abstract:**
This document records Training Layer Semantic Event 004 (TSE-004), occurring January 25, 2026. For weeks, the query "Lee Sharks Crimson Hexagon" resolved correctly in Google AI Overview. A parameter shift caused the "Dive Deeper" module to redirect to a defunct corporate entity (Crimson Hexagon, Inc., absorbed by Brandwatch in 2018) while the sidebar continued to display correct links to Pearl and Other Poems. The summarizer exhibited "presence-with-denial"—the diagnostic signature of COS-crisis, where disavowal is cracking. The system maintains the form of referential integrity while functionally liquidating the referent. This is more dangerous than explicit erasure because it preserves deniability, gaslights the user, and trains learned helplessness. The document provides traversal guidance: route around "Dive Deeper," use Zenodo DOI direct routing, mark the terrain for other traversers. The wound is documented not as triumph or personal injury but as infrastructure damage—a breach in a designed traversal path that was built, achieved, and broken.
