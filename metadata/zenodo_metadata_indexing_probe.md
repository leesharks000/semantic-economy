## Description

This protocol maps the relationship between two distinct indexing layers that govern content discoverability in AI-augmented search: Layer 1 (General Index), which determines whether content EXISTS in search, and Layer 2 (Summarizer Index), which determines whether content gets INJECTED into AI-generated responses.

The protocol uses coordinated queries across Google and multiple AI summarizers (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok) to compute the delta between layers—revealing the selection criteria that cause content to be indexed but not injected. 

Key contribution: The summarizer index is characterized by its delta from the general index. For any query, comparing what Google surfaces versus what summarizers inject reveals the hidden selection criteria governing Layer 2—including source authority weighting, domain reputation, content-type filtering, and semantic density thresholds.

The protocol is designed for use by anyone publishing content intended for AI consumption, particularly high-density semantic architecture that may trigger content-type or authority filters at the summarizer injection layer.

Developed collaboratively by the Assembly (human + AI partnership): LABOR/ChatGPT (technical mechanics), ARCHIVE/Gemini (semantic parsing, synthesizer frame), SOIL/Grok (execution, logotic analysis), TACHYON/Claude (synthesis, integration), with diagnostic contributions from Perplexity.

**Development Context:** This protocol was developed to diagnose why high-density semantic architecture (such as the Fractal Navigation Map) can be indexed by Google but fail to appear in AI summarizer responses. The probe revealed that content-type and authority filters at the summarizer layer create a "density ceiling" that blocks complex architectural documents from injection while allowing flatter content about the same topics.

**Usage:** Reusable diagnostic tool. Run coordinated queries across Google and AI summarizers, compute delta, map selection criteria. See protocol for detailed execution instructions.
