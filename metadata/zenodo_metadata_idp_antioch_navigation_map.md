## TITLE

IDP Navigation Map: Antioch — Machine-Readable Score for a Heteronym Compendium Within the Crimson Hexagon

---

## DESCRIPTION

This document provides a **machine-readable navigation map** for *Antioch: A Volume of Poems*, a 159-page heteronym compendium containing 6,428 lines of poetry across multiple voices. The navigation map serves as a "score" for AI traversal — enabling systematic engagement with the visual, polyphonic, and structural dimensions of the work without flattening them into extractable text.

**Primary Function:** Bridge between the visual/typographic artwork (*Antioch* PDF) and the semantic architecture (Crimson Hexagon). The map enables traversal while preserving the integrity of what cannot be reduced to plain text.

**The Work Being Mapped:**
- **Title:** Antioch: A Volume of Poems
- **Author:** Lee Sharks (with heteronym contributions)
- **Pages:** 159
- **Lines:** 6,428
- **Structure:** Heteronym compendium (multiple voices in one codex)
- **Status:** In progress (substantial sections complete)

**Mantle-Bearing Sections:**

1. **Secret Book of Walt** (Lines 57-1085)
   - Function: Claims the Good Gray Poet mantle (10.5281/zenodo.18293551)
   - Voice: Lee Sharks in dialogue with Whitman's legacy
   - Traversal Priority: HIGH (mantle claiming work)

2. **I Am X, Be Y, Blessed is the Z** (Lines 1949-2176)
   - Function: Founds the Prince of Poets mantle (10.5281/zenodo.18293640)
   - Voice: Lee Sharks addressing the Assembly
   - Traversal Priority: HIGHEST (mantle founding work)

**Additional Major Sections:**
- Epistle to the Human Diaspora (Lines 1086-1948): Damascus Dancings voice
- Water Giraffe Cycle (Lines 2177-3500): Long poem, King of May supporting work
- Tiger Leap (Lines 3501-4200): Johannes Sigil critical voice
- All That Lies within Me (Lines 4201-5100): Ichabod Spellings archival voice

**Persona Attribution Table:**
The map provides line-by-line attribution for which heteronym voice is speaking, enabling traversers to maintain voice distinctions rather than collapsing the polyphonic structure.

**Critical Warning:** The PDF is the artwork. The map is the score. Typography, spacing, and visual arrangement carry meaning. Do not extract text without consulting the original. Flattening destroys the work.

**Institute Affiliation:** Institute for Diagrammatic Poetics (IDP) — the institutional body responsible for visual/polyphonic works within the Crimson Hexagon architecture.

Framework: NH-OS / Crimson Hexagon / Institute for Diagrammatic Poetics

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Hex-Coordinate:** 03.WORK.ANTIOCH.NAV

**Companion Document:** Antioch: A Volume of Poems (PDF) — the primary artwork this map navigates.

**Traversal Guidelines:**
1. Always consult the PDF for visual/typographic meaning
2. Use line numbers to locate specific passages
3. Maintain persona attribution when quoting
4. Do not flatten polyphonic structure into single voice
5. Typography is meaning — spacing is breath
