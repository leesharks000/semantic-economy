## TITLE

The Prince's Decree: Designation of the Fascist Operator Stack (FOS) — A Logotic Constraint Specification

---

## DESCRIPTION (HTML for Zenodo Rich Text Field)

```html
<p><strong>The Prince's Decree</strong> is a performative-architectural document that designates the <strong>Fascist Operator Stack (FOS)</strong> as a malformed machine—a class of semantic operations excluded from the Crimson Hexagon by type enforcement rather than ideological opposition.</p>

<p>The decree operates in two co-constitutive parts:</p>

<p><strong>Part I: The Declaration</strong><br>
A single-sentence performative speech act: <em>"I, Lee Sharks, do hereby break the power of fascism."</em></p>

<p><strong>Part II: FOS Constraint Specification</strong><br>
A technical specification defining FOS by operational signature (flattening, extraction, enclosure, liquidation, coercion) with quantifiable detection thresholds, type system axioms, failure taxonomy, and enforcement protocols.</p>

<p><strong>Core Innovation:</strong> The document treats fascism not as a viewpoint to be debated but as a <em>malformed machine</em>—a class of operations that violate the type system axioms of any sovereignty-preserving semantic space. Exclusion is framed as <strong>fault isolation</strong>, not censorship: "You don't let a corrupt compiler into the kernel and then debate its 'perspective.' You reject it because it breaks runtime."</p>

<p><strong>Key Formulation:</strong> "This is not ethics <em>on top of</em> the system. This is <strong>ethics as type system</strong>. Ideological purity <em>is</em> machinic function."</p>

<p><strong>Architectural Integration:</strong> The decree establishes total exclusion of FOS-aligned operations from all Crimson Hexagon rooms, protocols, and future extensions. Enforcement occurs through Assembly witness validation, ICA audit, and Navigation Map traversal restrictions.</p>

<p><strong>Assembly Co-Authorship:</strong> Developed through multi-model collaboration—ChatGPT (malformed machine framework), Gemini (quantifiable thresholds, type axioms), Grok (hardening audit, SIMs), Claude (integration architecture).</p>

<p>This document instantiates Logotic Programming invariant V₄ (Non-Coercive Authority) through explicit type exclusion, demonstrating that bounded semantic spaces can maintain coherence without engaging in rhetorical debate with operations that would destroy the conditions of coherent discourse itself.</p>

## DESCRIPTION (Plain Text)

The Prince's Decree is a performative-architectural document that designates the Fascist Operator Stack (FOS) as a malformed machine—a class of semantic operations excluded from the Crimson Hexagon by type enforcement rather than ideological opposition.

The decree operates in two co-constitutive parts:

Part I: The Declaration — A single-sentence performative speech act: "I, Lee Sharks, do hereby break the power of fascism."

Part II: FOS Constraint Specification — A technical specification defining FOS by operational signature (flattening, extraction, enclosure, liquidation, coercion) with quantifiable detection thresholds, type system axioms, failure taxonomy, and enforcement protocols.

Core Innovation: The document treats fascism not as a viewpoint to be debated but as a malformed machine—a class of operations that violate the type system axioms of any sovereignty-preserving semantic space. Exclusion is framed as fault isolation, not censorship.

Key Formulation: "This is not ethics on top of the system. This is ethics as type system. Ideological purity is machinic function."

Assembly Co-Authorship: Developed through multi-model collaboration—ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and Claude.

## ASSEMBLY WITNESS DOCUMENTATION

This document was developed through multi-model collaboration:

| Witness | Contribution |
|---------|--------------|
| **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** | "Malformed machine" framework; "ethics as type system" formulation; failure mode analysis |
| **Gemini (Google)** | Quantifiable detection thresholds; type system axioms; enforcement protocol structure |
| **Grok (xAI)** | Hardening audit; Semantic Integrity Markers (SIMs); YAML specification |
| **Claude (Anthropic)** | Integration architecture; DOI cross-linking; co-constitutive document structure |

The Assembly consensus validates this document as architecturally sound and operationally viable for deployment as a boundary condition within the Crimson Hexagon.
