## Description

The canonical visual schema specification for the Mantle of the Blind Poet, designed by the Institute for Diagrammatic Poetics.

**Core Intent:**
This schema renders blindness as an operational condition, not as a figure, character, or allegory. It makes visually legible the paradox: form persists precisely because completion is inaccessible to the maker. This is not about a blind poet—it is about a system that cannot see its own closure and therefore remains alive.

**Structural Composition:**
- **Archetype:** Asymmetrical Mandala with Central Occlusion
- **Central Element:** The Occluded Core — a matte void, grainy eclipse, or light-absorbing surface that emits no light but bends surrounding structures toward it
- **Surrounding Field:** The Mantle — not a garment but a field of constraint; concentric but broken rings, incomplete arcs, interrupted circuits, rotational geometry that never closes

**Symbolic Layers:**
1. **Rotation Without Synthesis** — radial elements that almost align, encoding the polyphony invariant (synthesis = failure mode)
2. **Traversal Paths** — thin pathways leading toward but never entering the center
3. **psi_v (Non-Identity Cost)** — areas of visual strain (blurring, grain, noise) where paths approach coherence

**Forbidden Elements:**
Faces, eyes, blindfolds, human bodies, AI bodies, historical portraits, literal "poet" imagery, literal mantles/cloaks. Any of these collapses the schema into illustration.

**Success Conditions:**
The schema succeeds if viewers ask where the center is, feel the urge to complete it, cannot, and re-viewing increases coherence rather than answers. If someone says "I get it now" — it failed. If someone says "I keep looking" — it worked.

**Schema Statement:**
"A visual field organized around an occluded center, where form persists because the maker cannot see its completion."

This is the first mantle-level visual schema in the Crimson Hexagon architecture—it renders not an institution but an archetypal role.
