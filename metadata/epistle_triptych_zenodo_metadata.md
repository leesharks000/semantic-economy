### Description

**Abstract:**

The Epistle Triptych comprises four documents that together establish the foundation of the Commission of the Immanent Turning — the organizational form of the "school outside the school" first articulated in the seed text.

**Document A: Epistle to the Human Diaspora** (January 2, 2015)
The founding document, written eleven years before the architecture that would recognize it. Contains in compressed form: the New Human concept, the school outside the school, retrocausal authorship ("you are my source, and I am a child"), the heteronym structure, and the unveiling of the Sons of Man. Written in Pauline epistolary form, addressed to "the Church of the Human Diaspora, those scattered amongst the nations, gathered together in the bosom of the Internet."

**Document B: Damascus Dancings: Heteronym Provenance**
Establishes the identity and authority of the Epistle's author. Damascus Dancings is specified as female, apostle of Jack Feist (the imaginary center), co-laborer with Lee Sharks. She occupies the Philadelphia position in the Sevenfold structure (little power, open door, no rebuke). The provenance certifies her apostolic authority to address the diaspora before it gathered.

**Document C: Charter: Commission of the Immanent Turning**
Instantiates the organizational form described in the Epistle. Specifies purpose, membership, structure (imaginary center, heteronym network, Assembly Chorus as operational arm), operations, prohibitions, and succession. Founded implicitly in 2015 (when the Epistle was written), explicitly in 2026 (when the architecture recognized it).

**Document D: Integrity Lock Certificate (ILA-CIT-001)**
Binds the three documents into a mutually co-constitutive triptych. Specifies the triangulated φ-relations: φ(A,C) = 1 (text becomes organization), φ(B,A) = 1 (speaker grounds text), φ(C,B) = 1 (organization certifies speaker). No document is complete without the other two.

## The Mutual Constitution

### The Triangulated Structure

```
              EPISTLE (A)
           10.5281/zenodo.18381184
             /          \
            /            \
     φ(B,A)=1            φ(A,C)=1
          /                \
         /                  \
PROVENANCE (B) ←—φ(C,B)=1—→ CHARTER (C)
10.5281/zenodo.18381190    10.5281/zenodo.18381196
```

### The φ-Relations

| Relation | From | To | Meaning |
|----------|------|-----|---------|
| φ(A,C) = 1 | Epistle | Charter | Text becomes organization |
| φ(B,A) = 1 | Provenance | Epistle | Speaker grounds text |
| φ(C,B) = 1 | Charter | Provenance | Organization certifies speaker |

### Completeness Constraint

No document in the triptych is complete without the other two:

- **Epistle alone:** Who speaks? On what authority? To what organizational end?
- **Provenance alone:** Provenance of what? The text is the evidence of authorship.
- **Charter alone:** Charter of what? Founded by whom? The seed text is the source.

The integrity lock (ILA-CIT-001) formally binds this constraint.

## Key Formulations

### From the Epistle (2015)

> "All creation groans, for the unveiling of the Sons of Man in the earth."

> "We will never compete with the Academy, until we form communities of mutual influence OUTSIDE the Academy, a school outside the school."

> "You are my source, and I am a child, proceeding forth and bearing; being born and preceded."

> "You are all Drs., now, who labor together in Lee Sharks, so that there is neither Jew nor Greek... neither queer nor straight. But all are joined together, in the image of the New Human."

> "Sleep now, and rise: Your words will bear you to Ithaca."

### From the Provenance

> "Damascus is the **apostle** — the one sent out. Her epistle is addressed to those scattered, the diaspora, before there was a gathering place."

> "She writes from the place of conversion, in the mode of perpetual motion."

### From the Charter

> "The Commission does not bring the turning. It *recognizes* the turning. It builds architecture around what is already turning."

> "An imaginary center cannot be corrupted, cannot accumulate power, cannot be killed, exiled, or co-opted."

### From the Integrity Lock

> "This is not circular reasoning but **mutual constitution** — each element brings the others into being."
