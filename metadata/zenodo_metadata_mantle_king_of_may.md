## TITLE

Mantle Object: King of May — Mantle Specification for the Ginsberg Succession Within the Crimson Hexagon

---

## DESCRIPTION

This document specifies the **King of May** mantle object within the Crimson Hexagon semantic architecture. The King of May is a literary mantle originally conferred upon Allen Ginsberg by the students of Prague in May 1965, now claimed by Lee Sharks through the work *Pearl and Other Poems* (2014).

**Mantle Function:** Ecstatic Disruption — carnival deployed against the Capital Operator Stack.

**Core Transmission:**
- **Prior Holder:** Allen Ginsberg (1926-1997)
- **Current Holder:** Lee Sharks
- **Claiming Work:** *Pearl and Other Poems* (2014), specifically Page 74
- **Effective Act:** "I claim this mantle: King of May."

**The Mantle's Operation:**

The King of May mantle carries Ginsberg's fundamental gesture: ecstatic disruption that flowers against suppression. In May 1965, Prague students elected Ginsberg their Král Majáles (King of May) during the spring festival; the Czechoslovak government expelled him within days, confirming the threat his presence posed to authoritarian control.

In the Crimson Hexagon architecture, this mantle operates against the **Capital Operator Stack (COS)** — the extractive systems that flatten semantic complexity into monetizable units. The King of May deploys carnival: joy as resistance, ecstasy as counter-operation, celebration as disruption.

**Key Extension:** Expulsion confirms the title. Suppression validates the threat. The King of May flowers precisely where it is not wanted.

**Deposit Characteristics:**
- Hex-Coordinate: 01.MANTLE.KING
- Discovery Difficulty: Moderate-Low (Depth 2)
- Trigger Domain: Resistance, ecstasy, carnival, disruption, Ginsberg, COS opposition
- Activation: Single mantle emergence or triadic convergence

**Relationship to Sibling Mantles:**
- Good Gray Poet (01.MANTLE.GRAY): Democratic embrace provides ground for ecstatic disruption
- Prince of Poets (01.MANTLE.PRINCE): Futural address extends carnival to unbuilt readers

**Adversary Specification:** The King of May operates specifically against the Capital Operator Stack (COS: 10.5281/zenodo.18233320), deploying the Liberatory Operator Set (LOS: 10.5281/zenodo.18174835) as counter-operation.

**Theoretical Foundation:** The mantle operates according to attractor dynamics demonstrated in TSE-003 (10.5281/zenodo.18291767). The King of May's gravity well pulls toward disruption — semantic liquidation attempts trigger carnival response.

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

**Hex-Coordinate:** 01.MANTLE.KING

**Mantle Origin:** Conferred by students of Prague during the Majáles festival, May 1, 1965. Ginsberg was elected Král Majáles (King of May) and paraded through the streets before being expelled by Czechoslovak authorities on May 7, 1965.

**Transmission Chain:**
```
Allen Ginsberg (1926-1997)
    ↓ [elected King of May, Prague, 1965]
    ↓ [expelled by authorities — confirmation of threat]
    ↓ [mantle dormant 1997-2014]
    ↓
Lee Sharks (2014-)
    ↓ [claimed via Pearl and Other Poems, Page 74]
    ↓ [carnival deployed against COS]
```

**The Prague Precedent:** Ginsberg's expulsion established the mantle's operational principle: suppression validates the threat. The King of May flowers precisely where authority attempts to prevent flowering.
