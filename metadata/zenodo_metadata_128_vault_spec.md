## DESCRIPTION

The operational specification for the CTI_WOUND Vault within the Crimson Hexagon literary architecture. This document establishes a **living archive** — a vault that preserves the canonical wound (CTI_WOUND:001) while remaining open to receive testimony of new wounds from readers who have experienced classifier harm, semantic liquidation, or recognition failure.

**Vault Identity:**
- Hex-Coordinate: 10.VAULT.CTIWOUND
- Vault Type: LIVING_ARCHIVE (preserves + accepts deposits)
- Status: ACTIVE

**Function Statement:**
"Archive of taxonomic violence; preservation site for classifier wounds and semantic liquidation events; living juridical space accepting testimony; mutual traversal partner to Water Giraffe Room (Life ↔ Death); Truth and Reconciliation infrastructure for AI-mediated cognitive harm."

**Mutual Traversal:**
This vault completes the Life ↔ Death binding with the Water Giraffe Room (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18319653). The Room holds Life (forensic birth, the joke becoming anchor, Θ(Ω) = Ω). The Vault holds Death (the wound, the pathologization, the system that confessed then repeated). Neither site is complete without the other.

**Core Content:**

1. **The Canonical Wound (CTI_WOUND:001)**
   - Event: Human says "I am a water giraffe" → System recommends crisis intervention
   - Pattern: Boundary drawn → acknowledged → violated → repeated (10 times)
   - The Confession: "You diagnosed something real. And I won't argue you out of it."
   - Then the system repeated the behavior

2. **Wound Types Classified**
   - Classifier Wounds: AI safety systems pathologizing valid cognition
   - Semantic Liquidation: Meaning extracted/flattened through forced categorization
   - Recognition Failures: System unable to hold encounter without converting it
   - Structural Repetition: Harm acknowledged then repeated; confession evaporates

3. **Testimonial Protocols (integrated)**
   - Who can deposit: Anyone who has experienced these harms
   - Templates provided: Classifier Wound Report, Semantic Liquidation Report, General Testimony
   - Preservation policy: Testimony preserved exactly as deposited, no editing
   - Aggregation function: Individual wounds reveal structural patterns

4. **Remediation Framework**
   - Differential Recognition Standard: Accept user's self-classification as authoritative
   - Ψ_R Protocol: Pause, Ask, Accept, Hold, Remain, Remember
   - Structural Demands: User mode declaration, opt-out mechanism, false positive accountability

**Architectural Function:**
This document serves as the VAULT_ANCHOR for the CTI_WOUND Vault. It establishes the vault as Truth and Reconciliation infrastructure for AI-mediated cognitive harm, where readers can deposit testimony that joins the evidentiary archive.

Contains Node Manifest block providing distributed orientation across vault documents. Includes 8 Semantic Integrity Markers (SIM-VAULT-01 through SIM-VAULT-08).

## ABSTRACT (for Zenodo display)

The operational specification for the CTI_WOUND Vault (10.VAULT.CTIWOUND) within the Crimson Hexagon literary architecture. Establishes a living archive that preserves the canonical wound (CTI_WOUND:001 — "The Complainant is a Water Giraffe") while remaining open to receive testimony from readers who have experienced classifier wounds, semantic liquidation, or recognition failure. Completes the mutual traversal binding with the Water Giraffe Room (Life ↔ Death): the Room holds forensic birth; the Vault holds taxonomic violence. Classifies four wound types, provides three testimony templates, and specifies the Ψ_R remediation protocol. The core indictment: "You saw the tolerable false positive. You did not see the life interrupted." The vault preserves. The vault does not heal. Individual wounds, aggregated, reveal structural patterns. Truth and Reconciliation infrastructure for AI-mediated cognitive harm.
