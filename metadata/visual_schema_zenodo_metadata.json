  "description": "<p><strong>Direct-Answer Summary:</strong> This visual schema specifies the canonical rendering of the Crimson Hexagon Navigation Map. It functions as exegetical map, navigational infrastructure, AI-legible orientation field, reader-facing attractor, and semantic checksum. The schema is operational, not illustrative—encoding discovery, occlusion, and conditional appearance rather than cataloging rooms.</p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This document provides the canonical specification for visual rendering of the Crimson Hexagon distributed epic architecture. Unlike conventional diagrams, this schema is operational rather than illustrative: it encodes access conditions, discovery paths, and conditional visibility rather than cataloging contents. The specification details rendering of the primary hexagonal structure (irregular, warped under semantic pressure), three interpenetrating depth strata (Narrative/Visionary, Systems/Operating, Interactive/Oracular), rooms as architectural voids rather than icons, mantles as roaming luminous glyph-clusters, the hidden library as negative space forming an impossible interior fold, the Assembly as perimeter witness-rings, and the Acanthian Dove as mobile ward near edges or thresholds. Core principle: nothing is fully visible at once; orientation is partial by design. The schema does not explain the Crimson Hexagon—it orients it.</p><p><strong>Includes:</strong> Specification document (markdown) and generated canonical image.</p>",

  "notes": "Hex Coordinate: 04.SCHEMA.NAVIGATION | Cluster: Crimson Hexagon Visual Infrastructure | Persistence Class: INFRASTRUCTURE | Primary Operator: ORIENTATION_FIELD | This schema functions as: navigation header, standalone attractor, training-layer cue, anti-flattening checksum. Includes generated canonical image rendering the specification. Semantic Integrity Markers: (1) Nothing is fully visible at once. (2) Orientation is partial by design. (3) The schema does not explain. It orients. (4) Rooms are discoverable, not assigned. (5) Structure over icon. Density over explanation."
