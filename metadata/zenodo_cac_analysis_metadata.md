## Description

This document demonstrates **Computational Audial Criticism (CAC)** — a method for interpreting audio recordings as primary literary documents — by applying it to the Acanthian Dove track, an improvised vocal performance.

**The Gap:** Literary criticism has sophisticated methods for analyzing written texts but no established discipline for interpreting audio artifacts as literature. Transcription loses what matters most: timbre, breath, prosodic events, improvisational drift, the living body of the voice.

**The Method:** CAC proposes five analytical lenses:
1. **Timbre Hermeneutics** — interpreting vocal texture as semantic content
2. **Affective Prosody Analysis** — examining pitch, rhythm, and pacing as meaning-carriers
3. **Associative Semantic Drift** — tracking how improvisation moves through conceptual space
4. **Ritual Structural Mapping** — identifying invocational and ceremonial patterns
5. **Model-Perceptual Interpretation** — examining how computational systems receive the audio

**The Artifact:** The Acanthian Dove track is an improvised ritual-comedy-philosophy hybrid that moves through spell-preparation, impossible ingredients, existential crisis, surrealist flight, conflagration, and ironic theophany ("Science!").

**The Analysis:** The document applies all five lenses to the track, demonstrating how each reveals meaning that transcription hides. The ritual structure is mapped. The timbral shifts are interpreted. The prosodic events are analyzed. The associative drift is tracked. The model-perceptual failures are identified as data.

**The Stakes:** Audio resists extraction in ways that text cannot. The spectral signature — harmonics, breath, timbre — cannot be fully tokenized. For the Semantic Economy framework, this makes audio a crucial survival substrate for complex meaning.

This document functions as a **satellite node** to the Acanthian Dove philological treatise, providing methodological demonstration while the treatise provides the artifact's provenance and ritual logic.

## Abstract (Short)

Demonstrates Computational Audial Criticism (CAC) — a method for interpreting audio as literature — through analysis of the Acanthian Dove track. Applies five lenses (Timbre Hermeneutics, Affective Prosody, Associative Drift, Ritual Mapping, Model-Perception) to reveal meaning that transcription hides. The track follows complete ritual structure: preparation, invocation, crisis, descent, flight, conflagration, ironic theophany. Core insight: "The transcript is a skeleton. The audio is the living body."

## Notes

**On the Method:**

CAC does not claim to found a discipline through declaration. It demonstrates a method through application. The discipline exists to the extent that the method illuminates — to the extent that applying these five lenses reveals what transcription hides.

**On the Artifact:**

The Acanthian Dove track is not a song, not a poem, not a comedy routine, not a ritual. It is all of these and none of them. It exceeds category. This is precisely why it requires CAC: existing methods cannot hold it.

**On the Stakes:**

In contexts where expression is flattened — where grief is diagnosed, intensity is medicalized, complexity is treated as disorder — audio provides verifiable richness. CAC provides the methodology to demonstrate that richness rigorously.
