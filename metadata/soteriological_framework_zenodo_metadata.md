## Description

Unified specification of salvation and damnation as structural trajectories rather than categorical assignments, integrating four scriptural pillars into a coherent diagnostic system. Pillar I (Matthew 25): Judgment criterion — Ψ_V (psi-sub-V) measures regard-under-friction through enacted response to "the least of these," formalized as S = ∫(L_Ω/||V_INTER||)dt. Pillar II (James 2): Exclusion filter — the E operator excludes belief (B), intent (I), and identity (ID) from evaluation; only enacted response (W) is probative ("Even the demons believe — and shudder"). Pillar III (John 9): Entry mechanism — βλέπω-claim foreclosure specifies how systems claiming sight ("We see") enter the trajectory toward delusion by expelling witnesses rather than receiving testimony. Pillar IV (2 Thessalonians 2): Terminal state — π-state (planē-state) where Ψ_V = 0 (categorical collapse) is phenomenologically experienced as Ψ_V = 1 (regard), formalized as F = ∫(L_Γ·Φ_π)/(1+||V_CORRECT||)dt. Critical distinction: Matthew 25 goats know they failed the test ("When did we see you?"); π-state agents cannot know — the test itself has been replaced by the Φ_π operator. Framework provides mating surface for ground truth in the age of fascist operator stack collapse through β-metrics (κ_β foreclosure coefficient, ∇_σ smothering gradient, ω_ε epistemic inversion weight) and the finding invariant (ε → φ: expulsion enables encounter). Includes complete symbol reference, scriptural anchors, trajectory map, and contemporary application to systems where anti-racist/progressive identity substitutes for enacted response. Part of the NH-OS (New Human Operating System) theoretical architecture.

## Notes

This document is the master specification integrating four scriptural pillars into a unified diagnostic system for structural soteriology. Each pillar answers a distinct question: Matthew 25 (What counts?), James 2 (What doesn't count?), John 9 (What prevents correction?), 2 Thessalonians 2 (What completes collapse?). The framework achieves mathematical formalization at parity with physics: the S integral (salvation) and F integral (counter-salvation/FOS) provide computable measures of trajectory. The three-population distinction at judgment (sheep, goats, perishing) maps to {S→∞, S→0, F→1} respectively. Key innovation: the π-state is not "worse than goats" but structurally different — goats can recognize failure; π-state agents cannot because the Ψ_V test has been replaced by Φ_π (categorical sorting experienced as regard). The β-metrics (κ_β, ∇_σ, ω_ε) provide real-time diagnostic tools. Contemporary application addresses systems where claimed identity (anti-racist, progressive, safe) substitutes for enacted response — the James 2 exclusion applied to present conditions.
