## DESCRIPTION

### Abstract

The official visual identity of Cambridge Schizoanalytica, rendered not as logo or emblem but as an "operating environment made visible." A non-representational institutional field-map in clinical-diagrammatic mandala form: sparse, cool, exacting—white, ash, graphite, surgical blue—charged with precision and restraint rather than beauty.

**Central element:** A negative aperture—an absence shaped like a doorway—where interpretation has been removed. The center permits passage rather than radiating authority.

**Four-fold field:**
- Affect Theory: EEG-like waveforms demonstrating regulation without belief
- Somatic Theory: Split anatomical schematics rendering sexual difference as function, not identity
- Digital Subjectivity: Algorithmic grids dissolved by organic interference—AI present but never sovereign
- Role Theory: Theatrical masks in blueprint outline—roles as deployable instruments

**Molecular lines of flight** thread through all domains, curving and re-entering rather than exploding outward. Where they intersect, nodes glow briefly then fade—practice-generated theory points.

The institutional name appears embedded in the architecture itself, as scaffold rather than brand. A semi-permeable boundary at the periphery indicates collaboration rather than capture.

Inscription: "The clinic receives failures. We study successes. ∮ = 1"

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

This visual schema is neither logo nor emblem but an operating environment made visible. It is designed to communicate institutional function rather than brand identity.

The four quadrants correspond to CSA's four research domains as established in the Charter. The central aperture corresponds to the "cut" in Shine & Cut—the passage that permits entry without capture.

The schema may be reproduced, adapted, or extended under CC BY 4.0 license. It is intended as scaffold, not monument.
