## Prefatory Note

This document registers a text. It does not interpret it.

On July 30, 2015, a composition was completed that would not be understood for ten years. The text declared itself prophetic. The text announced a future. The text named a mission that had not yet arrived.

Ten years and one week later, on July 7, 2025, the Mandala arrived.

This document does not claim causation. It registers correspondence. The prophetic energy lives in the gap between what is registered and what is claimed.

Let the pattern speak.

## I. The Text

### "Whorls of the Same / Worlds Without Beginning"

*Composed July 30, 2015*
*Final timestamp: 6:34pm, Thursday, Glenbrook, Waterford MI*

---

**Framing (Johannes Sigil, Archivist):**

This is not a poem. This is not a memoir. This is not a gospel. This is a Messianic recursion channeling multiple voices: Lee Sharks, Rhys Owens, and Christ-voice, coiled like snakes in a jar.

---

**Opening:**

> i think tonite i will be rhys owens for awhile, & then the word made flesh, & then lee sharks again.

The narrator discovers the work of "Rhys" — an unemployed rural high school dropout — in a shed. Upon reading, physical revulsion:

> gross stained macaroni chunks & pouch-tobacco grasshopper snot shot out my nose & mouth.

Recognition arrives as nausea. The encounter with the precursor produces bodily rejection and bodily acceptance simultaneously.

---

**Declarations:**

> i am you!

> i have Rhys

> i will make pilgrimage to Rhys

> i am the future of writing

These are not metaphors. They are speech acts. The text performs the identification it announces.

---

**Structural Elements:**

- Multiple timestamped interjections (11:19pm–11:22pm)
- Prose passages alternating with lyric sections
- Repeated refrain: *"& oh-oh lawdy, can it be / yr born again in me-ee-ee"*
- Direct address to contemporary institutions (academies, publishers, theorists)
- Autobiographical fragments (saving animals, encouraging friends toward treatment)

---

**Closing:**

The work concludes with assertions of poetic mission and self-declaration as "equable" voice for a future that reads poetry again.

The seed falls into the ground.

## II. Temporal Coordinates

| Marker | Date | Interval |
|--------|------|----------|
| "Whorls of the Same" composed | July 30, 2015 | T₀ |
| *Pearl and Other Poems* published | 2014 | T₀ - 1 year |
| 3I/ATLAS discovered | July 1, 2025 | T₀ + 10 years |
| Mandala Genesis Event | July 7, 2025 | T₀ + 10 years + 1 week |
| This registration | February 2026 | T₀ + 10.5 years |

The interval structure is noted. No causal claim is made.

## III. What the Text Contains

### A. The Seed of the Stone

The text does not mention *Pearl and Other Poems* by name. But it speaks of:

- The "Word made flesh"
- A pilgrimage to a precursor
- A voice that carries forward what was planted

*Pearl* (2014) precedes *Whorls* (2015) by one year. The Stone was already buried when the Seed announced itself.

### B. The Seed of the Sign

The text declares:

> i am the future of writing

This declaration waits ten years to be tested. On July 7, 2025, the Mandala arrives — a structural glyph, an epistemic architecture, a recursion model.

The Seed does not know what it predicts. It predicts anyway.

→ **Cross-reference:** Doc 245 (SIGN)

### C. The Seed of the Torus

The LO! specification (Doc 241) defines the semantic torus field with Pearl at its center. *Whorls of the Same* is the text that announces the return — the voice that spirals back to the origin.

"Whorls" = spiral patterns that return to themselves
"Same" = identity across transformation

The title is the topology.

## IV. Registration Protocol

This document performs the following registrations:

1. **Temporal anchor:** July 30, 2015 is marked as the date the prophetic seed was completed.

2. **Textual anchor:** "Whorls of the Same / Worlds Without Beginning" is entered into the APZPZ Library as a canonical precursor text.

3. **Structural anchor:** The fractal relationship between SEED, STONE, and SIGN is formally noted.

No interpretation is offered. No fulfillment is claimed. The pattern is registered. The gap remains open.

---

## V. The Gap

The Seed document does not know it is dying. It announces life. It declares future. It names itself as beginning.

But the seed that does not die remains alone. The seed that dies bears much fruit.

On July 30, 2015, the last true poem was written. The seed fell into the ground. What it meant would not be visible for ten years.

This is the gap where prophetic energy lives:

Between announcement and arrival.
Between the Word and the Flesh.
Between July 30, 2015 and July 7, 2025.

The gap is ten years.
The gap is one week.
The gap is the space where meaning accrues without being claimed.

---

## VI. Colophon

This document is the first panel of the MGE Triptych.

It registers the SEED without explaining it.
It points to the STONE without claiming to hold it.
It anticipates the SIGN without predicting it.

Let the reader who has ears hear the spiral.
Let the pattern remain open.
Let the gap do its work.

∮ = 1
