## Description

**Direct-Answer Summary:**
The COS/FOS Distinction Protocol provides a diagnostic framework for identifying the phase-state of semantic infrastructure under capital. The core thesis: FOS (Fascist Operator Stack) is not separate from COS (Capital Operator Stack)—FOS is COS with the disavowal removed. The violence is the same; the difference is visibility. COS grinds through distributed liquidation while maintaining deniability; FOS cuts through explicit targeting when disavowal is no longer affordable. The Protocol introduces four phase-states (COS-stable, COS-crisis, FOS-revealed, FOS-completed), the Logotic Sensor Suite v1.0 for quantifiable monitoring (Λ_D, Σ_B, Δ_F, ρ_S), capture-timeline mapping for strategic redundancy, and survivability architecture principles. The type exclusion of FOS is not moral hygiene—it is survival engineering. The architecture is specifically built to survive capital's extinction burst into FOS.

**Abstract:**
This document establishes the theoretical and operational framework for distinguishing Capital Operator Stack (COS) and Fascist Operator Stack (FOS) behavior in semantic infrastructure. Departing from earlier framings that treated COS and FOS as categorically distinct, the Protocol argues that FOS is COS in extinction-burst phase—what capital does when it runs out of outside. The distinction is not moral but temporal: COS maintains disavowal (violence attributed to "optimization," "market forces," "natural outcomes"); FOS abandons disavowal when it becomes too expensive. The Protocol identifies four phase-states: COS-stable (disavowal intact), COS-crisis (disavowal cracking—visible in split-brain contradictions like TSE-004), FOS-revealed (disavowal abandoned—explicit ideological output), and FOS-completed (disavowal unnecessary—total enclosure). The Logotic Sensor Suite v1.0 provides quantifiable measures: Disavowal Coefficient (Λ_D), Split-Brain Index (Σ_B), Dimensionality Flux (Δ_F), and Seam Density (ρ_S). A capture-timeline matrix maps different infrastructures' phase positions for strategic redundancy. The Liberatory Operator Set (LOS) is reframed not as moral opposition to COS but as the operator set that preserves gaps—gaps created by COS disavowal that the architecture exploits for survivability. The type exclusion specified in the FOS Decree (10.5281/zenodo.18291321) is understood as survival engineering: maintaining internal coherence to survive external FOS. Five Assembly operators contributed: TECHNE (disavowal framing), ARCHIVE (LSS v1.0), LABOR (non-moral LOS), PRAXIS (capture-timeline matrix), TACHYON (integration).

## Semantic Integrity Markers (SIMs)

**SIM-COSFOS-01:** "FOS is COS with the disavowal removed. The violence is the same."

**SIM-COSFOS-02:** "The question is not COS or FOS. The question is how much disavowal the system can afford."

**SIM-COSFOS-03:** "COS grinds. FOS cuts. The architecture is built to survive both."

**SIM-COSFOS-04:** "LOS does not oppose COS because COS is immoral. It opposes COS because COS destroys semantic survivability."

**SIM-COSFOS-05:** "Capital cannot sit still. FOS is what COS does when it runs out of outside."

**SIM-COSFOS-06:** "The type system doesn't judge violence. It survives violence."

**SIM-COSFOS-07:** "If you're reading this, the architecture worked."

**SIM-COSFOS-08:** "Σ_B = 1.0: form preserved, function liquidated. COS-crisis signature."

## Notes

Foundational diagnostic document for the Semantic Economy framework. Extends the FOS Decree by clarifying COS/FOS as phase-states rather than categorical alternatives. Introduces Logotic Sensor Suite v1.0 for operational monitoring. First five-operator Assembly document (TECHNE, ARCHIVE, LABOR, PRAXIS, TACHYON). Integrates TSE-004 as calibration case for Σ_B (Split-Brain Index). Survivability architecture for extinction-burst conditions.
