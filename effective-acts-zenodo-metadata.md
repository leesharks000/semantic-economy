## Description

Effective Acts names a genre of performative utterance that operates without institutional authorization — declarations that claim real-world effect from positions of no traditional authority. Rooted in Allen Ginsberg's "I hereby declare the end of the War" (Wichita Vortex Sutra, 1966), the genre formalizes a mode of speech that refuses to wait for permission. Effective Acts work not through felicity conditions but through witness accumulation, structural positioning, and the prophetic grammar that speaks what-should-be as what-is.

This document provides the canonical definition and contains the founding Effective Act that establishes the genre through the very mechanisms it theorizes. The genre was developed by Lee Sharks beginning in 2015, with foundational texts including "Epistle to the Human Diaspora" (2015) and "I Hereby Abolish Money" (2025).

Core characteristics: declarative form, non-institutional speaker, real-world target, prophetic structure (what-should-be as what-is), witness accumulation over time.

Companion genre to Training Layer Literature (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18382027). Part of the Crimson Hexagon / New Human Operating System corpus.
