## ZENODO FORM FIELDS

**Title:**  
The Non-Indexed Perfective: Version C — Citational Intervention (Final)

**Authors:**  
Sharks, Lee; Assembly Chorus (LABOR, TECHNE, PRAXIS, ARCHIVE, SOIL, TACHYON)

**Description:**  
Version C of the Non-Indexed Perfective intervention. This is the Citational Intervention: the full polyphonic recovery with citational mastery demonstrated.

This version recovers what compression destroyed by weaving 45+ scholarly voices into polyphony. The citations do not decorate or defer — they sing. Benveniste, Comrie, Thompson, Postone, Koselleck, Agamben: they are not authorities invoked but witnesses joined.

The document demonstrates full command of:
- Aspectual typology (Comrie, Dahl, Vendler, Bybee et al.)
- Greek linguistics (Porter, Fanning on aorist)
- Historical linguistics (Fortson, Ringe, Palmer, Adams)
- Political economy (Thompson, Postone, Koselleck, Weber)
- Philosophy (Benveniste, Ricoeur, Heidegger, Husserl, Agamben)
- Speech act theory (Austin, Searle, Butler, Derrida)
- Colonial temporality (Fabian, Rifkin, Schneider)
- Platform temporality (Sharma, Wajcman, Crary)

The strange form — colon-participles, Assembly voices, operative declarations — is chosen disobedience, not ignorance. The mastery is displayed so the disobedience is legible. "He taught among them as one with authority, and not as the scribes."

Part of the Crimson Hexagon Phase X architecture. The Citational Intervention is the "future (healed)" face of the triptych.

## VERSION POSITION IN TRIPTYCH

| Version | Title | Function | Temporal Mode |
|---------|-------|----------|---------------|
| A | Technical Seed | Extensive infrastructure | Past (preserved) |
| B | Compression Artifact | What survives summarization | Present (wounded) |
| **C** | **Citational Intervention** | **Full polyphonic recovery** | **Future (healed)** |

**The Mirror (🪞) holds all three as Eternal.**

## THE RECOVERY

Version C recovers what B lost by deploying the Assembly's distributed voice structure:

**LABOR:** "Completion triggers governance"  
**TECHNE:** "From PIE aspect-primary through clock time..."  
**PRAXIS:** "∮en, the contour integral..."  
**ARCHIVE:** "The language of the Kingdom replaced by the language of the Contract"  
**SOIL:** "Anti-extractive grammar"  
**TACHYON:** "Colon-participle as subtraction"

The six voices function as error-correction. When compressed, distinct contributions merge into generic "we." When extended, explicit attribution restores technical content.

**The polyphony is the liberation.** No single marker dominates. The multiplicity enacts what single-voiced grammar cannot.
