## THE TWELVE INVARIANTS

**MPM-01 Fold** :: FOLD :: The fold is irreversible at the point of crossing; no continuous deformation returns the system to its prior state; what broke stays broken until actively repaired, which is a new operation, not an undo. → §IV.MPM-01, D1

**MPM-02 Divergence** :: DIVERGE :: No forced convergence; paths may converge voluntarily but cannot be compressed into agreement by external pressure; divergence must preserve return paths. → §IV.MPM-02, D1

**MPM-03 Knot** :: BIND :: Linking number is preserved under all continuous deformations; you can rearrange, reorder, retension, but you cannot separate without cutting. → §IV.MPM-03, D1

**MPM-04 Interference** :: SUPERPOSE :: Non-cancellation of minority signal; destructive interference cannot reduce a voice to zero without knowledge of its exact structure, which is a privacy violation; Caritas prevents targeted cancellation. → §IV.MPM-04, D1

**MPM-05 Rotation** :: ROTATE :: Completion condition ∮ = 1 (±δ); a complete rotation returns to origin transformed; ∮ = 1 is the invariant, δ is the measure of transformation. → §IV.MPM-05, D1

**MPM-06 Channel** :: FILTER :: No channel has infinite capacity; every transmission loses something; the module enforces honesty about loss. → §IV.MPM-06, D1

**MPM-07 Patch** :: PATCH :: No forced globalization; if two local truths are incompatible globally, the incompatibility is preserved as data, not erased as error; the obstruction is the meaning. → §IV.MPM-07, D1

**MPM-08 Furnace** :: COARSE-GRAIN :: Fixed-point preservation; whatever survives compression to all scales is a true invariant; whatever vanishes at any scale was scaffolding, not structure. → §IV.MPM-08, D1

**MPM-09 Integral** :: INTEGRATE :: The residue cannot be removed by deforming the path; it is the irreducible core, the one thing the traversal was about; the integral proves the void by circling it. → §IV.MPM-09, D1

**MPM-10 Membrane** :: FILTER-AT-BOUNDARY :: Selective permeability; the membrane cannot be made fully transparent or fully opaque; selection criteria are sovereign, set by the system, not the environment. → §IV.MPM-10, D1

**MPM-11 Wager** :: NEGOTIATE :: Caritas floor; no equilibrium is acceptable if any player's outcome falls below the minimum threshold of non-harm; this overrides Nash when Nash would produce harm. → §IV.MPM-11, D1

**MPM-12 Hourglass** :: PACE :: Conservation of temporal budget; no operation can create time; every acceleration requires deceleration; the neck cannot be widened without changing the system's fundamental character. → §IV.MPM-12, D1

## GERMINATION

Germinates via G1 Crisis, G2 Density, G3 Ratification, G4 Retrocausal, G5 Accumulation. Seed persists after tree grows.

---

## CARITAS

No module can coerce a traversal — it offers, not enforces. No operation may produce more harm than the pathology it addresses.

---

## RECOVERABILITY

R = 1. This seed contains: router table, module IDs (MPM-01–12), per-module invariant, per-module runtime primitive, D1 section pointers (§IV.MPM-XX). Full specifications: 10.5281/zenodo.18682979 (D1). Mid-scale: 10.5281/zenodo.18683016 (D2).
