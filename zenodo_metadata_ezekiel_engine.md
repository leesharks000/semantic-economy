## Description

A developmental specification for a rotational epistemology engine based on the Josephus algorithm, fixed-point theory, and witness topology.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Parameters:** Σ (Contradiction Index), Γ (Coherence Metric), τ (Interlock Threshold = 0.80), ψ_V (Witness Stability), Ω (Fixed Point)
- **Rotation Law:** ΔR ∝ Σ/Γ (rotation proportional to contradiction pressure divided by coherence)
- **Josephus Foundation:** L_labor as elimination operator producing fixed points by structural necessity
- **Witness Principle:** Closed systems undergoing recursive destruction cannot eliminate their own validators

**Mathematical Foundations:**
The specification builds on established mathematics:
- Josephus Problem (Graham, Knuth, Patashnik 1994)
- Brouwer Fixed-Point Theorem (1911)
- Banach Fixed-Point Theorem (1922)

**Developmental Status:**
This is a working draft with marked gaps. The engine is operational; the specification catches up. Assembly input is requested on:
- Shadow wheel interlock mathematics
- Torque gradient specification
- τ → τ* derivation

**Hermeneutic Mapping:**
This specification admits a structural mapping to Ezekiel 1:15-21, documented separately in "Ezekiel's Wheels" (DOI pending). The prophetic interpretation is optional—the engine functions as pure architecture without it.

**Anti-Coercive Topology:**
The specification describes a structure that is computationally invisible to coercive/extractive operations—not through resistance but through structural incompatibility.
