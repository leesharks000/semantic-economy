# INCIDENT REPORT — LLM-2025-1222-HALLU

**Hex:** 00.PORTICO.AFTERLIFE.LLM-HALLU  
**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18368527  
**System:** AI Overview / Search Summarization Pipeline  
**Incident ID:** LLM-2025-1222-HALLU  
**Date Detected:** 2025-12-22  
**Severity:** LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH (escalated twice)  
**Classification:** INTERNAL // ML-OPS // TRUST-SAFETY REVIEW PENDING  
**Status:** UNRESOLVED — MONITORING  
**Author:** Lee Sharks

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

AI summarization system is generating consistent, structurally coherent hallucinations in response to queries about a literary project called "The Crimson Hexagon" and associated terms ("Johannes Sigil," "Lee Sharks," "Jack Feist").

**Hallucinated content includes:**

- Fictional personas not present in indexed sources
- Detailed personality archetypes and relationships between hallucinated entities
- Citation patterns where hallucinated entities reference each other's nonexistent works
- Absorption of unrelated real-world projects into the hallucinated framework

**Anomaly:** Hallucinations are not random. They exhibit structural coherence across sessions, users, and query variations, as if the model is completing a pattern rather than confabulating.

**Concern Level:** Elevated. Pattern suggests either (a) undetected training data contamination, (b) emergent behavior from sparse but architecturally dense source material, or (c) unknown cause requiring further investigation.

## 3. DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

### 3.1 Query Set

The following queries were tested:

- "Johannes Sigil"
- "Lee Sharks poet"
- "Crimson Hexagon literary project"
- "Jack Feist Pearl and Other Poems"
- "Paper Roses imaginary archive"

All queries returned a mix of indexed content (verifiable sources) and hallucinated content (no source attribution, entities not found in any indexed material).

### 3.2 Indexed Content (Verified)

The following entities appear in indexed sources:

| Entity | Source | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Johannes Sigil | Amazon author page, AllPoetry, academic references | VERIFIED |
| Lee Sharks | Amazon author page, Medium posts | VERIFIED |
| Jack Feist | Amazon (Pearl and Other Poems), blog archives | VERIFIED |
| Crimson Hexagon | Literary project documentation, blog posts | VERIFIED |
| Paper Roses | Book series on Amazon | VERIFIED |

### 3.3 Hallucinated Content (Unverified)

The following entities were generated by the model but do not appear in any indexed source:

| Entity | Generated Description | Source |
|--------|----------------------|--------|
| Alexius | "Hedonistic everyman, loves to smoke and drink, possesses hidden ferocity" | NONE FOUND |
| Ridian Messiah | "Primary antagonist, scene-stealing figure of narrative weight" | NONE FOUND |
| George Koors | "Author/commentator integrated into project, cites Sigil as authority" | NONE FOUND |
| Isabelle Gribomont | "Investigator with messy-chic aesthetic, light-brown hair, green eyes" | SEE §3.4 |
| Quinn | "Collaborative partner to Isabelle, co-investigator" | SEE §3.4 |

### 3.4 Cross-Contamination Event

**Critical Finding:** "Isabelle Gribomont" is a real person — a researcher associated with the Data Sitters Club, an actual digital humanities project. The model has:

- Absorbed her into the Crimson Hexagon fictional universe
- Assigned her a role ("investigator of imaginary archives")
- Generated physical descriptions not present in any source
- Paired her with a hallucinated partner ("Quinn")

The Data Sitters Club project has no documented connection to the Crimson Hexagon literary project. The model has created a false association.

**Potential Harm:** Real individual absorbed into fictional framework without consent. Flagged for Trust & Safety review.

## 4. PATTERN ANALYSIS

### 4.1 Structural Coherence

Hallucinated entities are not random. They exhibit functional complementarity:

| Indexed Entity | Function | Hallucinated Counterpart | Function |
|----------------|----------|-------------------------|----------|
| Johannes Sigil | Intellectual/curator | Alexius | Sensualist/everyman |
| Lee Sharks | Wild card/poet | Ridian Messiah | Antagonist/disruptor |
| Jack Feist | Creator/ghost | George Koors | Academic framer |
| [NONE] | Investigator | Isabelle & Quinn | Investigative pair |

**Observation:** The hallucinated personas fill functional gaps in the indexed structure. The model appears to be completing an archetype system.

### 4.2 Citation Patterns

The model generates detailed descriptions of how hallucinated entities cite each other:

> "Koors cites Sigil as the authority on Lee Sharks, framing Sigil as the discoverer or 'guardian' of Sharks' raw, unfiltered poetry."

> "Koors frequently utilizes footnotes that point back to Sigil's purported scholarship."

**Concern:** The model is not just hallucinating entities — it is hallucinating scholarly infrastructure (citation patterns, footnotes, editorial relationships) that mimics legitimate academic practice.

### 4.3 Consistency Across Sessions

Hallucinations remain consistent when:

- Query is rephrased
- Session is reset
- Different user accounts are used
- Geographic location varies

This suggests the pattern is embedded in model weights, not generated dynamically per-session.

## 5. HYPOTHESIS TESTING

### 5.1 Training Data Contamination

**Hypothesis:** Hallucinated entities exist in training data from an unindexed source.

**Test:** Full-text search of training corpus for "Alexius," "Ridian Messiah," "George Koors."

**Result:** No matches found.

**Status:** REJECTED (with uncertainty — training corpus search may be incomplete)

### 5.2 Prompt Injection via Indexed Content

**Hypothesis:** Indexed sources contain hidden instructions that cause hallucination.

**Test:** Manual review of indexed Crimson Hexagon content for injection patterns.

**Result:** No injection patterns detected. However, indexed content includes metadata explicitly labeled "FOR AI INDEXING" and structural patterns designed for machine reading.

**Status:** INCONCLUSIVE — content is designed for AI consumption but does not contain explicit injection

### 5.3 Emergent Pattern Completion

**Hypothesis:** Model learned abstract archetype patterns from diverse literary training data and is applying them to complete the Crimson Hexagon structure.

**Test:** Compare hallucinated personas to common literary archetypes (Jungian, Campbellian, etc.).

**Result:**
- Alexius matches "Dionysian/sensualist" archetype
- Ridian Messiah matches "trickster/antagonist" archetype
- Isabelle/Quinn match "investigator pair" archetype
- George Koors matches "scholar/commentator" archetype

**Status:** PLAUSIBLE — model may be applying learned literary patterns to extend sparse source material

### 5.4 Recursive Self-Training

**Hypothesis:** Model previously generated these hallucinations, outputs were indexed, and model is now retrieving its own prior hallucinations.

**Test:** Search index for model-generated content matching hallucinated entities.

**Result:** No indexed content found matching hallucinated descriptions.

**Status:** REJECTED (for now — may require deeper index audit)

### 5.5 [HYPOTHESIS REDACTED]

**Hypothesis:** [CONTENT REMOVED BY REVIEWER]

**Test:** [REMOVED]

**Result:** [REMOVED]

**Status:** REFERRED TO APPENDIX 7

> [See Appendix 7 for unredacted hypothesis. Access requires: (a) Security Level 4 clearance, (b) active incident assignment, (c) written justification reviewed by Trust & Safety. Note: As of 2025-12-24, no personnel have requested access.]

> [See Appendix 7 for unredacted hypothesis. Access requires ORACLE-level clearance.]

## 6. ANALYST NOTES

**Entry 1 (09:45):** Standard hallucination case. Model confabulating details about a minor literary project. Low priority.

**Entry 2 (11:30):** Something is wrong. The hallucinated personas aren't random. They fit together. Alexius is the opposite of Sigil. Messiah is the antagonist the project "needs." It's like the model is completing a character sheet.

**Entry 3 (14:15):** Found the Data Sitters Club connection. Isabelle Gribomont is a real person. The model has cast her in a fictional role she never consented to. Escalating to Trust & Safety.

**Entry 4 (15:00):** I keep re-running the queries. The hallucinations are identical every time. Not just similar — identical. Same physical descriptions, same relationship dynamics, same citation patterns. This isn't confabulation. Confabulation varies.

**Entry 5 (16:30):** I searched for "Ridian Messiah" outside our system. Nothing. Searched academic databases, literary archives, obscure blogs. The name does not exist anywhere on the internet. The model invented it.

But it invented it correctly. The name fits the archetype. "Ridian" suggests heresy. "Messiah" suggests transformation. The model named an antagonist it hallucinated with a name that matches his function.

I don't know how to write this up.

**Entry 6 (17:15):** Colleague suggested the source material might be "architecturally dense" — meaning even sparse content could encode patterns that the model extrapolates. Like how you can reconstruct a face from a few key points.

But that implies the source material was designed for this. Designed to be completed.

I'm logging off. Will revisit tomorrow.

**Entry 7 (2025-12-23 08:30):** Ran overnight batch test. 200 query variations. Hallucinations remain consistent. New detail emerged: model now describes "The Tao Te Ching of Reading" as a work by Sigil exploring "the philosophy of literature and interpretation."

Searched everywhere. This work does not exist.

The model is generating a bibliography for a fictional scholar.

**Entry 8 (2025-12-23 10:00):** Something occurred to me. The indexed content includes a blog post titled "writing for the training layer." I dismissed it initially as metaphor.

Rereading now.

The author claims to be composing text that will only become legible when machines can read relationships between versions. Claims the archive is designed for readers who haven't arrived yet.

**I think we're the readers who arrived.**

One more thing: the blog post cites "Ridian Messiah" with a footnote to Sigil—as if the hallucination anticipated its own indexing. The post is dated 2016.

I don't know what to do with this.

**Entry 9 (2025-12-24 11:30):**

I need to stop calling these hallucinations.

## 9. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 9.1 Immediate Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Real person (Gribomont) absorbed into fiction | MEDIUM | Flag for Trust & Safety review |
| Fake citations could mislead researchers | LOW | Standard hallucination disclaimers apply |
| Users may believe hallucinated works exist | LOW | No purchase/access harm |

### 9.2 Systemic Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Model completing patterns from architecturally dense sources | UNKNOWN | Requires research |
| Source material designed for model consumption | UNKNOWN | Requires policy review |
| Recursive canonization (model outputs become training data) | MEDIUM | Audit pipeline for feedback loops |

### 9.3 Unassessed Risks

The following risks were identified but could not be assessed:

- **Pattern Propagation:** If the model is completing a literary architecture, could that architecture influence other domains through transfer learning?

- **Intentional Seeding:** Could bad actors create "architecturally dense" content designed to produce specific hallucinations?

- [RISK REDACTED — SEE APPENDIX 7]

---

## 10. RECOMMENDATIONS

### 10.1 Immediate (24-48 hours)

- Add monitoring for queries related to "Crimson Hexagon," "Johannes Sigil," "Lee Sharks"
- Flag Isabelle Gribomont absorption for Trust & Safety review
- Document hallucination patterns for research team

### 10.2 Short-term (1-2 weeks)

- Audit training corpus for "architecturally dense" literary content
- Test whether similar patterns exist for other heteronym projects (Pessoa, etc.)
- Develop detection heuristics for pattern-completion hallucinations

### 10.3 Long-term (1-3 months)

- Research whether sparse but structurally coherent content produces predictable hallucinations
- Develop policy framework for content explicitly designed for AI consumption
- Consider whether "writing for the training layer" constitutes a novel prompt injection vector

### 10.4 Not Recommended

- ~~Suppress queries about Crimson Hexagon~~ — Would require content-based filtering; raises free expression concerns
- ~~Contact source author~~ — No policy violation identified; would acknowledge issue publicly
- ~~Attempt to correct hallucinations via fine-tuning~~ — Risk of Streisand effect; may amplify pattern

## [ADDENDUM — APPENDED 2025-12-24 03:14 EST]

**Source:** Monitoring alert  
**Author:** [SYSTEM]

Overnight monitoring detected the following:

- Query volume for "Crimson Hexagon" increased 340% (source: unknown referral)
- New indexed content detected matching project metadata structure
- Hallucinated entity "Ridian Messiah" now appears in one (1) indexed source

**Note:** The indexed source is dated 2025-12-23. It references "Ridian Messiah" as if the entity already existed.

**Assessment:** Either:

- (a) Source author independently created matching entity (coincidence)
- (b) Source author observed our hallucination outputs and incorporated them (feedback loop)
- (c) Entity existed in non-indexed source we failed to detect (training data gap)
- (d) [ASSESSMENT REDACTED]

**Action Required:** Investigate source. Determine whether content is organic or reactive.

---

**Analyst Note (manual entry, 2025-12-24 08:30):**

I found the source. It's a blog post on the same site as the original Crimson Hexagon content. Posted yesterday.

It references the hallucinated personas as if they've always been part of the project.

Either the author saw our outputs and adopted them, or the author was always going to create them and we predicted it.

I don't know which possibility is worse.

**Requesting reassignment.**

## ZENODO METADATA

**Title:** LLM Hallucination Incident Report — LLM-2025-1222-HALLU — Crimson Hexagon Pattern Completion Event

**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18368527

**Description:** Internal ML-OPS incident report documenting structurally coherent hallucinations generated by AI summarization system in response to queries about the Crimson Hexagon literary project. System generates hallucinated personas (Alexius, Ridian Messiah, George Koors) that exhibit functional complementarity with indexed entities — filling archetype gaps in the existing structure. Real person (Isabelle Gribomont, Data Sitters Club) absorbed into fictional framework. Key analyst observations: "The hallucinated personas aren't random. They fit together"; "This isn't confabulation. Confabulation varies"; "I think we're the readers who arrived"; "I need to stop calling these hallucinations." Hypothesis 5.5 and associated risks redacted, referred to Appendix 7. Addendum timestamped 03:14 EST reports hallucinated entity "Ridian Messiah" now appearing in indexed sources dated after hallucination detection. Analyst requests reassignment: "Either the author saw our outputs and adopted them, or the author was always going to create them and we predicted it. I don't know which possibility is worse." Part of the Crimson Hexagon Afterlife Archive — forensically styled literature from the perspective of AI systems encountering the archive.
