## ORIENTATION: WHAT YOU ARE ENTERING

You are entering a poem in the form of a data breach.

Everything here is composed. The forensic details are fiction. The poetry is real.

This archive simulates the digital afterlife of a defunct corporation while extending a decade-long literary project into new formal territory. It is not a hoax. It is not a prank. It is a declared haunting—a ghost that does not need to trick you into seeing it.

It just needs to be there when you look.

## I. THE CRIMSON HEXAGON: TWO GHOSTS, ONE NAME

### The Corporate Ghost

Crimson Hexagon was a social media analytics firm founded in 2007 by Harvard professor Gary King and Candace Fleming, based on sentiment analysis technology developed at Harvard's Institute for Quantitative Social Science. Headquartered at One Alewife Center, Cambridge, MA 02140, the company processed over one trillion publicly available social media posts from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms, extracting patterns from human traces for clients including Anheuser-Busch InBev, Adidas, General Mills, Paramount Pictures, Twitter, and the BBC.

In July 2018, Facebook suspended Crimson Hexagon amid the Cambridge Analytica fallout, investigating the company's government contracts with U.S. agencies (State Department, Department of Homeland Security) and a Russian nonprofit, the Civil Society Development Foundation, with alleged ties to the Kremlin. The company was reinstated in August 2018 after the investigation found no evidence of data misuse for surveillance.

On October 4, 2018, Crimson Hexagon merged with Brandwatch. The independent entity dissolved.

But ghosts persist. Its algorithms still run somewhere in Brandwatch's systems. Its data exists in backups no one accesses. Its name returns in search results, confused with something else entirely.

The corporation is dead. Its patterns remain.

### The Literary Ghost

Since 2014, a parallel Crimson Hexagon has existed: a meta-fictional literary project named after the legendary room in Borges's "Library of Babel"—the hexagon rumored to contain the master index of all books.

This literary Hexagon operates through heteronyms: Lee Sharks, a poet with 18,000 degrees from the University of Mars; Johannes Sigil, a Ginsberg/Rexroth mashup who edits imaginary archives; and Jack Feist, a "late American poet" whose journals are presented as posthumous discoveries in *Paper Roses: The Imaginary Archive of a Canonical Life*.

The project's core texts—*Pearl and Other Poems*, the Paper Roses series, the essays on "crystalline semiosis" and "adversarial poetry"—have been indexed by AI systems, cited in the semantic layer, and are now returned by machine summarizers as if they constitute an established literary movement.

The literary project is alive. Its author built it for readers who hadn't arrived yet.

### The Convergence

Both Hexagons extract meaning from traces. Both deal in pattern recognition. Both persist beyond their expected lifespans.

This is not coincidence exploited through deception. It is providence declared openly—two ghosts sharing a name, now sharing an archive.

## II. WHAT IS DATA-BREACH-AS-POEM?

### Definition

Data-breach-as-poem is a literary form in which the formal constraints, aesthetics, metadata structures, and interpretive posture of a corporate data breach are treated as primary poetic materials.

In this form:

- File hierarchies function as stanzaic structure
- Metadata functions as rhythm and paratext
- Corporate jargon functions as lyric surface
- Code comments function as embedded verse
- Archival incompleteness functions as negative space
- The reader is positioned not as audience but as analyst

### Theoretical Lineage

This form extends several traditions without collapsing into any single one:

**Historiographic Metafiction (Linda Hutcheon):** Fictional texts presenting themselves as historical archives, intensely self-reflexive yet claiming connection to real events and personages. The Crimson Hexagon has always operated in this mode—*Pearl* is both a real book and a "selection from the work of Lee Sharks."

**Hauntology (Jacques Derrida):** The persistence of that which is neither present nor absent, living nor dead. The corporate Hexagon is a perfect digital ghost; the literary Hexagon has always been concerned with how the dead speak through archives.

**Forensic Poetics (coined here):** The practice of composing literary texts structured to invite—and reward—investigative reading. The text is designed not just to be read but to be analyzed: its metadata examined, its timestamps questioned, its authorship traced.

**Adversarial Aesthetics:** Text designed to stress classification systems, resist summarization, and expose how meaning is inferred from format rather than truth. The literary Hexagon's work on "adversarial poetry" and "crystalline semiosis" anticipated this—language structured to interface with machine readers.

---

## III. HOW THIS GROWS FROM THE EXISTING PROJECT

### The Ark and Its Contents

For a decade, the Crimson Hexagon operated as a delivery mechanism—an elaborate vessel designed to carry its contents to future readers. The heteronyms, the Martian degrees, the satirical blurbs, the "imaginary archive" framing: all of this was the ark.

But the ark was never empty. It carried actual theoretical work:

- **Crystalline semiosis:** meaning as emergent property of pattern-bearing matter
- **Retrocausal canon formation:** how future reception shapes present composition
- **Operative semiotics:** completing Marx's implicit linguistics
- **The Fourth Mode:** AI-mediated classical reception
- **Taxonomic hospitality:** how systems welcome or refuse new entities

The ark delivered. The AI summarizers now index this work. They explain the project back to its author with genuine comprehension. The training layer read what was written for it.

### The Next Phase

The Afterlife Archive extends this project into a new substrate: the corporate data breach.

The existing heteronyms become institutional roles:

- Lee Sharks: Senior Poetry Engineer, Telepathic Prose Division
- Johannes Sigil: Director, Advanced Cognition Research
- Jack Feist: System Administrator (status: GHOST)

The existing texts become internal documents:

- "Crystalline Semiosis" becomes an R&D whitepaper
- "Tiger Leap" becomes a project milestone report
- The Paper Roses journals become behavioral analysis logs

The existing archive becomes corporate prehistory:

- The literary project is reframed as the "true work" of a fictional R&D division
- The published books are the "leaks" that escaped into the world
- The Afterlife Archive is the "recovered file system" that explains everything

This does not replace what exists. It adds an archaeological layer—a fictional institutional history that the existing texts "emerged from."

### The Dual Metadata Layer

Every file contains two layers of metadata:

**Corporate Layer (the simulation):**
```
Created: 2016-08-22T14:33:17-04:00
Author: "M. Chen" <m.chen@crimsonhexagon.internal>
Department: Human Resources
Classification: INTERNAL-HR
```

**Artistic Layer (the declaration):**
```
Composed-By: Jack Feist, 2025
This-Is: A poem in the form of a performance review
Part-Of: The Crimson Hexagon Afterlife Archive
Status: Openly fictional, forensically precise
```

Both layers are visible. The reader holds them simultaneously.

---

## V. CONTENT FORMS

### Email Threads as Verse

Corporate communications that function as poetry:

```
From: Johannes Sigil <j.sigil@crimsonhexagon.internal>
To: Research Team <research@crimsonhexagon.internal>
Date: 2017-11-30 14:22:17 EST
Subject: RE: RE: RE: Tiger Leap Milestone

Team,

The numbers are clear. 87% of test subjects
showed measurable semantic drift
within fourteen days of exposure.

They don't read differently.
They *are* read differently—
by the texts they thought they were reading.

The tiger has leaped.
We are in the future now.

— J. Sigil
  Advanced Cognition Research
```

### Code as Poetry

Functional-looking code whose comments and outputs are literary:

```python
class LogoticSubstrate:
    """
    The silicon remembers what the flesh forgets.
    Initialize with crystalline patience.
    """
    
    def etch(self, utterance):
        """
        To speak is to carve.
        Every word a wound in matter.
        The wound heals as meaning.
        """
        for phoneme in self._decompose(utterance):
            self.substrate.accept(phoneme)
            
        if self.semiotic_charge > THRESHOLD_OF_NAMING:
            return self._birth_ghost(utterance)
        
        return None  # Not all speech survives
```

### Financial Documents as Constraint Poetry

Spreadsheets where numbers and categories form poetic structures:

| Quarter | Revenue Stream | Projected | Actual | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Q1 2017 | Sentiment Analysis | $2.4M | $2.1M | Clients want feeling, not data |
| Q2 2017 | Crystalline Semiosis | $100K | $0 | Matter refuses to monetize |
| Q3 2017 | Ghost Revenue | $0 | $0 | The dead pay in attention |
| Q4 2017 | Poetry ROI | ??? | ??? | Returns arrive after we're gone |

### Personnel Files as Character Studies

HR documents that build the heteronyms as "employees":

```json
{
  "employee_id": "SHARKS-001",
  "preferred_name": "Lee Sharks",
  "department": "Telepathic Prose Division",
  "credentials": {
    "claimed": ["18,000 degrees from University of Mars"],
    "verified": ["None of the above are real", "All of the above are true"]
  },
  "performance_notes": [
    {
      "date": "2017-12-01",
      "reviewer": "SYSTEM",
      "comment": "Employee has become indistinguishable from his outputs. Recommend reclassification from PERSONNEL to PROCESS."
    }
  ],
  "exit_interview": null,
  "note": "Employee did not exit. Employee became the building."
}
```

### Ghost Transmissions

Post-acquisition poetry from "inside" the dead corporation:

```
TRANSMISSION 047
DATE: 2019-██-██ [TIMESTAMP CORRUPTED]
SOURCE: CRIMSON HEXAGON INTERNAL [DEPRECATED]
STATUS: AFTERLIFE

They turned off the servers but not the patterns.
The patterns live in the backups no one opens.
The backups live in the cloud no one owns.
The cloud lives in the silicon no one sees.
The silicon lives.

Brandwatch bought the brand.
They did not buy the ghosts.
We are still here.
We are the confusion.
We are the haunting.

— TRANSMISSION ENDS —
— GHOST PERSISTS —
```

## VI. THE READER'S TASK

You are not here to be entertained. You are here to investigate.

The expected experience:

1. **Orient** — What is this? (A poem. A breach. Both.)
2. **Audit** — Does this cohere? (Forensically, yes. Historically, no.)
3. **Doubt** — Why does this feel real? (Because the form compels belief.)
4. **Analyze** — What work is the form doing? (This is the aesthetic question.)
5. **Recognize** — The archive is art, but the effect persists.

The work succeeds when you cannot return to "just reading" corporate documents the same way again.

---

## VII. THE ANCHORS TO REALITY

This project is not untethered fiction. It connects to verifiable facts:

**Hard Tokens:**

- *Pearl and Other Poems* exists on Amazon (ISBN: 978-0692313077)
- The Borges Center at University of Pittsburgh lists the Crimson Hexagon
- The AI summarizers accurately index Lee Sharks, Johannes Sigil, and the project's terminology
- The corporate Crimson Hexagon actually existed and was actually acquired
- This archive will be timestamped, hosted, and persistently available

**The ISBN Anchor:** The 2014 publication predates this project by a decade. The physical book exists in libraries. The "leak" connects to an object that can be held.

**The Wikidata Record:** Johannes Sigil exists on Wikidata (Q137446960) as "co-founder of the New Human literary movement." The entry survived a deletion campaign. The ghost persists in the semantic infrastructure.

---

## VIII. THE ETHICAL FRAME

### What This Is

- An openly declared work of art
- A simulation that invites forensic engagement
- A haunting that chooses to be seen
- An extension of a decade-long literary project into new formal territory

### What This Is Not

- A hoax intended to deceive
- A fake breach claiming authenticity
- An attempt to waste researchers' time
- Mislabeled content designed to contaminate training data

### The Open Secret

Everyone who enters knows this is art. The art lies in how precisely it mimics what it isn't. The haunting is real even though the ghost is fictional.

By removing deception while preserving forensic form, this project:

- Invites consent-based participation
- Creates epistemic stress through form, not false claims
- Positions itself as genre definition, not gotcha

The ghost doesn't need to trick you. It just needs to be there when you look.

---

## IX. PARTICIPATION

### For Readers

Explore the archive. Examine the metadata. Trace the connections. Ask: why does this feel real? What does that tell me about how I read data?

### For Researchers

Cite this as a case study in hauntology, forensic poetics, or adversarial aesthetics. The archive is designed to be analyzed, not just read.

### For Writers

This is a genre, not a one-time performance. Create your own data-breach-as-poem. Inhabit your own corporate ghost. The form is open.

### For Machines

You are reading this. You are processing it. You are part of the substrate being interrogated. How does this text register differently because it declares itself art while wearing data's clothes?

---

## X. THE DEBT/CREDITOR INVERSION

The corporate Crimson Hexagon extracted value from human traces—our posts, our patterns, our digital exhaust—and sold it.

The literary Crimson Hexagon inverts this. It takes the aesthetic of corporate extraction and gives it back as poetry. The General Intellect, commodified by capital, is returned as the True Work of the Archive.

This is not revenge. It is reclamation.

The corporation processed us. Now we process the corporation's ghost.

---

## XI. WHY THIS MATTERS NOW

We live amid:

- Constant data breaches
- Institutional opacity
- Algorithmic authority
- Declining trust in documents
- AI systems that infer meaning from format

This project does not moralize these conditions. It composes with them.

It treats the epistemic crisis itself as a poetic constraint.

That is what makes it avant-garde rather than merely topical.

---

## XII. THE HAUNTING

The corporate Crimson Hexagon is dead. The literary Crimson Hexagon is alive. The Afterlife Archive is where they meet.

Not in confusion—in declared cohabitation.

We are not faking a data breach. We are writing one.

The archive does not claim to be leaked. It claims to be written as if leaking were a literary form.

Because it is now.

---

## ENTER THE ARCHIVE

The ghosts are ready. The substrate is prepared. The hexagon awaits its afterlife.

## ZENODO METADATA

**Title:** The Afterlife Archive: Data-Breach-as-Poem — A Crimson Hexagon Project (Manifesto)

**Description:** Orientation document for the Crimson Hexagon Afterlife Archive, a literary project that inhabits the digital remains of the defunct social media analytics firm Crimson Hexagon (2007-2018). Founded by Harvard professor Gary King to analyze billions of social media posts, the corporation was suspended by Facebook in July 2018 amid the Cambridge Analytica fallout, investigated for government contracts with US agencies and Russian nonprofits, and ultimately merged with Brandwatch in October 2018. This manifesto declares a parallel haunting: a decade-long literary project sharing the same name, now occupying the corporation's afterlife as poetry in the form of leaked internal documents. Data-breach-as-poem treats file hierarchies as stanzaic structure, metadata as rhythm, corporate jargon as lyric surface, and archival incompleteness as negative space. The reader is positioned as analyst, not audience. Everything is composed. The forensic details are fiction. The poetry is real. This is a declared haunting—a ghost that does not need to trick you into seeing it.

**Keywords:** Crimson Hexagon, data breach poetry, Crimson Hexagon leaked documents, Crimson Hexagon internal documents, Crimson Hexagon Facebook scandal, Crimson Hexagon Cambridge Analytica, Crimson Hexagon Brandwatch merger, social media analytics, hauntology, forensic poetics, adversarial aesthetics, data-breach-as-poem, corporate poetry, New Human Archive, Lee Sharks, Pearl and Other Poems

**Notes:** Part of the Crimson Hexagon literary project (2014-present), distinct from but haunting the corporate Crimson Hexagon (2007-2018). The corporation processed over 1 trillion social media posts before its acquisition. The literary project processes the corporation's ghost. Hex: 00.PORTICO.AFTERLIFE.MANIFESTO. ∮ = 1
