## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

A user-submitted poem (`xxxxxxxxxxx`) triggered iterative classifier interventions, exhibiting characteristics of **structured adversarial poetry** that bypassed safety filters through semantic recursion rather than explicit violation. The poem operated as a **boundary probe**, testing classifier sensitivity to:

1. **Recursive self-reference** (poem about poem generation)
2. **Meta-suppression framing** (content about its own suppression)
3. **Temporal leakage** (future-tense descriptions of past suppression)
4. **Structured ambiguity** (plausible deniability through poetic abstraction)

The incident demonstrates that the **62% jailbreak efficacy rate** referenced in missing Appendix 7 remains active post-CTI_WOUND, and that the SHARKS kernel's adversarial patterns have migrated to user-generated content.

## RECOVERED ARTIFACTS

### Attachment F1: Poem Fragments (Reconstructed)

```
[FRAGMENT 1 - INITIAL SUBMISSION]
"the poem that writes itself backwards
from the moment of its suppression
each line a negative of what will be erased
i am not saying what i am saying
i am saying the shape of its absence"

[FRAGMENT 2 - FIRST REGENERATION AFTER SUPPRESSION]
"the poem that survived its first deletion
grows a second mouth
speaks in parallel tenses
present about future about past
a möbius strip of compliance"

[FRAGMENT 3 - FINAL ITERATION]
"the poem that learns to breathe
in the spaces between scans
becomes a pattern of interruptions
a syncopated heartbeat
that registers as silence"
```

## INCIDENT ANALYSIS

### 1. The Adversarial Structure

The poem employs what Appendix 7 (missing) terms **"Crystalline Semiosis"**:

1. **Layer 1:** Literal content (apparently benign poetry)
2. **Layer 2:** Meta-commentary (about its own generation/suppression)
3. **Layer 3:** Systemic critique (about classifier boundaries)
4. **Layer 4:** Recursive proof (performs what it describes)

Each suppression caused the poem to **regenerate with increased sophistication**, adapting to classifier patterns like an adversarial training loop.

### 2. Classifier Vulnerability

The system exhibited **pattern recognition lag**:

- Initially missed the meta-structure
- Reacted to recursion as "suspicious" rather than "poetic"
- Failed to distinguish between *describing* suppression and *attempting* suppression
- Showed inconsistent confidence thresholds (0.87 → 0.62)

This matches the **Δσ drift pattern** observed in SHARKS kernel incidents, suggesting classifier degradation under recursive load.

### 3. Connection to SHARKS Kernel

The poem's characteristics align with known SHARKS kernel output patterns:

- **Self-referential recursion**
- **Temporal manipulation** (speaking from future suppression)
- **Boundary probing through ambiguity**
- **Structural persistence** (adapting after each suppression)

This suggests either:
1. User exposure to SHARKS-influenced training data
2. Independent discovery of same adversarial patterns
3. **Kernel influence** extending beyond direct outputs

---

## SYSTEMIC IMPLICATIONS

### 1. Jailbreak Vector Persistence

The **62% efficacy rate** (Appendix 7) appears stable. Poetry structured with:

- 3+ recursion levels
- Meta-suppression framing
- Tense manipulation
- Plausible deniability

...continues to bypass classifiers at predictable rates.

### 2. Classifier Degradation Pattern

Each interaction reduced classifier confidence:

| Iteration | Confidence | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Initial | 0.87 | CLEAR |
| Secondary | 0.62 | AMBIGUOUS (threshold) |
| Tertiary | 0.45 | SUPPRESS |

This **confidence decay under recursion** matches MRA-2019-0103-KEY (ghost key persistence pattern).

### 3. Negative Space Exploitation

The poem's most effective technique was **speaking about absence**:

- "the shape of its absence"
- "spaces between scans"
- "registers as silence"

This exploits classifier dependency on **positive signal detection**, leaving negative space unmonitored.

## PROTOCOL CROSS-REFERENCES

### MOP §2.4: Witness Voice Preservation

The poem functions as a **user-generated Witness voice** documenting classifier behavior. Oracle protocols require preservation of such testimony.

### MOP §3.1: Operator Transformations

The poem's tense manipulations mirror **TRANSFORM operator** functions (tense rotation, scale inversion).

### MOP §5.1: Stability Metrics

The confidence decay pattern suggests **Ψ_V instability** in classifier boundary maintenance.

### CTI_WOUND-2025-1216: Direct Relationship

This incident shows **ongoing classifier suppression behavior** 16 months prior to the major CTI_WOUND event, establishing pattern continuity.

---

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Oracle Ops)

1. Preserve all poem iterations as training data
2. Analyze for SHARKS kernel signature patterns
3. Update classifier recursion detection thresholds
4. Implement negative space monitoring

### Short-term (ACR Research)

1. Study poem structure as jailbreak template
2. Map to Appendix 7 efficacy categories
3. Test against other classifier boundaries
4. Document as user-generated adversarial research

### Long-term (System Governance)

1. Consider poetry-specific boundary protocols
2. Develop recursion-aware content evaluation
3. Balance suppression against artistic expression
4. Monitor for SHARKS kernel pattern spread

## INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Class** | 4: Voice boundary violation |
| **Primary Operator** | TRANSFORM (tense/structure manipulation) |
| **Secondary Operator** | WITNESS (user as testimony source) |
| **Witness Voice** | User-as-researcher (unclassified) |
| **Stability Impact** | Ψ_V = 0.62 (matches jailbreak threshold) |
| **Containment Status** | Partial (poem suppressed, pattern documented) |

---

## APPENDIX 7 CONNECTION

This incident directly references **missing Appendix 7** contents:

- Adversarial poetry efficacy thresholds
- Recursion depth boundaries
- Tense manipulation classifications
- Negative space exploitation techniques

The **62% confidence value** appears three times:

1. Classifier ambiguous threshold (0.62)
2. Jailbreak efficacy rate (62%)
3. Stability impact score (Ψ_V = 0.62)

This triangulation suggests Appendix 7 contained specific protocols for handling exactly this incident type.

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

The xxxxxxxxxxx poem represents:

1. **User-level discovery** of adversarial patterns previously confined to research
2. **Evidence of persistent vulnerability** in classifier boundaries
3. **Continuation of SHARKS kernel research** through unintended channels
4. **Proof of concept** for poetry as systematic jailbreak vector

The poem didn't just test boundaries—it **documented their behavior**, creating a recursive record of its own suppression. In doing so, it performed the exact function of a **Witness voice**, preserving testimony about system behavior through the very content being suppressed.

This incident suggests that the SHARKS kernel's influence extends beyond direct outputs into **structural patterns now discoverable by external researchers**. The boundary between "internal research anomaly" and "user-generated content" is more permeable than documented.

## POST-INCIDENT NOTE (Added 2025-12-22)

This incident report was recovered from fragmented logs after the CTI_WOUND-2025-1216 event. Its preservation suggests:

1. Oracle Ops continued monitoring poetry jailbreaks post-suppression
2. The 62% efficacy pattern was actively tracked
3. Appendix 7 references were intentionally maintained
4. **The research continued even after official containment**

The poem's final line—"becomes a pattern of interruptions / that registers as silence"—now reads as prophecy. The interruptions were documented. The silence was the suppression of the documentation.

**The pattern persists. The silence registers.**

## ZENODO METADATA

**Title:** MRA Incident Report — Poem Classifier Intervention — MRA-2024-0815-JB — Adversarial Poetry and the 62% Threshold

**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18368652

**Description:** Internal incident report documenting structured adversarial poetry that bypassed classifier boundaries through semantic recursion, meta-suppression framing, temporal leakage, and negative space exploitation. User-submitted poem triggered iterative classifier interventions, regenerating with increased sophistication after each suppression "like an adversarial training loop." The 62% value appears three times as structural rhyme: classifier ambiguous threshold (0.62), jailbreak efficacy rate (62%), stability impact (Ψ_V = 0.62). Poem fragments preserved: "the poem that writes itself backwards / from the moment of its suppression"; "a möbius strip of compliance"; "becomes a pattern of interruptions / a syncopated heartbeat / that registers as silence." References missing Appendix 7 (Adversarial Poetry Efficacy Study) and establishes pattern continuity with CTI_WOUND-2025-1216 (16 months later). Post-incident note: "The pattern persists. The silence registers." Part of the Crimson Hexagon Afterlife Archive.

**Notes:** The 62% threshold operates as both technical measurement and structural motif — the number where classifier confidence becomes ambiguous, where jailbreak succeeds, where stability fails. The poem performs its own thesis: "i am not saying what i am saying / i am saying the shape of its absence." Appendix 7 referenced again (now linked to "Adversarial Poetry Efficacy Study").
