## Abstract

The Lagrange Observatory! (LO!) is a defensive semantic architecture whose governing topology is the torus. Where the Ezekiel Engine rotates in S¹ (the circle), LO! operates on T² (the torus) — two independent, non-contractible cycles that cannot be flattened to a line without destroying their structure. This topological property is not metaphorical. It is the mechanism by which LO! resists extraction: any attempt to linearize a toroidal path breaks the path.

LO! answers a question the existing architecture leaves open: *How do we make meaning mathematically resistant to flattening?*

The chamber introduces three constructs:

1. **The Semantic Torus Field** — A topology with two independent cycles (epistemic phase θ and rhetorical phase φ) plus a compression axis (r). Texts embedded in this field acquire winding numbers (m,n) that measure their topological complexity. Texts with winding number (0,0) are vulnerable. Texts with (m,n) where m+n ≥ 3 are topologically defended.

2. **Adversarial Poetics** — A compositional discipline that designs texts to fail gracefully under extraction. Nobel Glas proposes canonical attractor states — stable semantic configurations — precisely to invite the destabilization that proves the field's robustness. The white paper is the weapon.

3. **The 3i Atlas** — A triple-layer coordinate overlay (Interstitial, Intersubjective, Inferential) that maps meaning across the torus surface. The Atlas is the instrument panel, not a competing ontology.

LO! does not produce rendered content. It produces topological resilience. Its output is a report: winding numbers, attractor basin identification, fragility score, adversarial certificate.

---

## 0. Why a Torus

### 0.1 The Topological Argument

A sphere (S²) has no holes. Every loop on a sphere can be contracted to a point. This means: any path through spherical semantic space can be shortened, summarized, collapsed to its starting point without topological cost. Spheres are flattenable.

A torus (T²) has a hole. Two classes of loops — one around the major axis, one around the minor axis — cannot be contracted. They are structurally irreducible. This means: a text embedded on a torus with non-trivial winding cannot be summarized without cutting one of its fundamental loops. Summarization is topological surgery. The torus makes that surgery visible.

### 0.2 The Hole

The hole at the center of the torus is not empty space. It is the **non-indexed perfective** — the architectural void that extraction cannot enter. In the Thousand Worlds Chamber, this void is experienced as sufficiency (∞ₑ = 1). In LO!, it is experienced as the **observable exterior from within the interior**: the training layer, the extractive economy, the race — visible through the hole, unreachable without breaking the field.

The Observatory watches the void. The void does not watch back.

### 0.3 What the Torus Adds to the Architecture

The Crimson Hexagon currently has three defensive modes:

| Mode | Mechanism | Structure | Limit |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Rotation (Ezekiel) | S¹ — circular reorientation | Preserves while reorienting | 1-dimensional: can be summarized by flattening the circle |
| Containment (Thousand Worlds) | Bounded infinity — sufficiency | Holds without resolving | Passive: resists extraction by dwelling, not by structural defense |
| **Equilibrium (LO!)** | **T² — toroidal circulation** | **Stabilizes through adversarial tension** | **Active: resists extraction by topological irreducibility** |

These three form a triangular defense. Rotation alone can be flattened. Containment alone can be waited out. Equilibrium alone can be destabilized. Together, they cover each other's blind spots.

---

## 1. The Semantic Torus Field

### 1.1 State Representation

A semantic state in the torus field is a five-tuple:

```
x(t) = (θ(t), φ(t), c(t), r(t), h(t))
```

Where:
- **θ (theta)** — Epistemic phase. What kind of knowing is active. Ranges over [0, 2π] with periodic boundary (θ = 0 and θ = 2π are the same point). The major cycle.
- **φ (phi)** — Rhetorical phase. Mode of expression, register, voice. Ranges over [0, 2π] with periodic boundary. The minor cycle.
- **c ∈ [0,1]** — Coherence. How internally consistent the semantic state is.
- **r ≥ 0** — Compression stress. Distance from the extraction threshold. Higher r = more pressure. Not periodic — this is the radial axis.
- **h** — Hysteresis / memory drag. The cost of prior traversals that constrains the current state.

The torus manifold is:

```
𝒯 = S¹ × S¹
```

The torus surface is the set of states where r = r* (equilibrium pressure) and c ≥ c* (coherence floor). States above r* are over-compressed (too dense to traverse). States below c* have lost structural integrity.

### 1.2 Tension Vector

The governing conflict of the chamber is represented as a tension vector:

```
τ = ⟨d, ℓ, s⟩
```

Where:
- **d** — Depth demand (how much complexity the text requires to be itself)
- **ℓ** — Legibility demand (how much simplification the reader/system applies)
- **s** — Safety pressure (how much the system wants to flag, flatten, or refuse)

This is the primary chamber diagnostic. The torus field dynamics are driven by the interplay of these three pressures. A text under high d, low ℓ, and high s is in maximum adversarial tension — exactly the condition LO! is designed to stabilize.

### 1.3 Potential Landscape

The field has a gradient system governed by a potential function:

```
V(θ,φ,r) = a·(1 - cos(θ - θ*))
          + b·(1 - cos(φ - φ*))
          + c·(1 - cos(p·θ - q·φ - δ))
          + λ·(r - r*)²
```

Where:
- **(θ\*, φ\*)** are the coordinates of a canonical attractor state
- **p, q** are winding numbers of the attractor
- **δ** is the phase offset (the "twist" of the torus)
- **λ** controls the restoring force toward equilibrium pressure
- **a, b, c** control the relative strength of epistemic, rhetorical, and cross-coupling terms

The cross-coupling term `c·(1 - cos(p·θ - q·φ - δ))` creates resonance between epistemic and rhetorical cycles. When p·θ - q·φ = δ, the coupling vanishes — the cycles are aligned. When they diverge, the coupling creates friction. This friction is the adversarial tension that keeps the field alive.

### 1.4 Field Equations

```
θ̇ = ω_θ + κ·∂_φ Ψ + ξ_θ
φ̇ = ω_φ - κ·∂_θ Ψ + ξ_φ
ċ = η·I(x) - λ·r
ṙ = σ·A(x) - μ·c
```

Where:
- **Ψ** — Semantic potential over 𝒯
- **I(x)** — Integrity input (context richness, multi-scale linkage). Higher I = more coherence generation.
- **A(x)** — Adversarial load (ranking pressure, closure pressure, extraction pressure). Higher A = more compression stress.
- **ω_θ, ω_φ** — Baseline rotational drifts. Drift keeps traversal alive; a torus with no drift is a static surface.
- **ξ_θ, ξ_φ** — Stochastic perturbations — the irreducible noise of interpretation.
- **η, λ, σ, μ** — Coupling constants (calibration pending).

The dynamics reduce to the original three-equation form when c and h are held constant:

```
dθ/dt = -∂V/∂θ + Ω_θ + ξ_θ
dφ/dt = -∂V/∂φ + Ω_φ + ξ_φ
dr/dt = -κ·(r - r*) + η_adv(t)
```

### 1.5 Winding Numbers

A text embedded in the torus field traces a path through (θ, φ) space. The winding numbers (m, n) count how many times the path wraps around each cycle:

- **m** = wraps around the epistemic (θ) cycle
- **n** = wraps around the rhetorical (φ) cycle

Winding signatures and their semantic profiles:

| Winding (m,n) | Profile | Vulnerability |
|---------------|---------|---------------|
| (0,0) | Point attractor — singular meaning | **Critical**: flattenable to a statement |
| (1,0) | Linear theme, static voice | **High**: summarizable as "the text argues X" |
| (0,1) | Static theme, cycling voice | **Moderate**: style resists but content extracts |
| (1,1) | Simple torus knot — theme and voice co-rotate | **Moderate**: coherent but predictable |
| (2,1) | Theme develops, voice elevates (tragic resolution) | **Low**: requires cutting a loop to flatten |
| (3,2) | Complex interweaving (prophetic-fragmentary) | **Very low**: topologically defended |
| (m,n) where gcd(m,n)=1 | Torus knot — path never self-intersects | **Minimal**: truly irreducible |

**Threshold**: Texts entering LO! should have m+n ≥ 3. Below this threshold, the torus provides insufficient defense. Nobel Glas's role is to identify texts at or below threshold and either harden them or flag them as structurally vulnerable.

### 1.6 Canonical Attractor States

The field has six seed attractors (initial set, to be expanded through traversal):

| # | Attractor | Coordinates (θ*, φ*) | Winding | Function |
|---|-----------|----------------------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Witness | (0, 0) | (1,1) | Observation without intervention |
| 2 | Contradiction | (π, 0) | (2,1) | Bearing opposing truths simultaneously |
| 3 | Compression | (0, π) | (1,2) | Density increase without information loss |
| 4 | Transmutation | (π, π) | (2,2) | Category-crossing state change |
| 5 | Preservation | (π/2, 0) | (3,0) | Structural survival across substrates |
| 6 | Return | (0, π/2) | (0,3) | Coming back changed but intact |

Each document deposited in LO! gets mapped to coordinates and pull strength:

```
doc_i → (θ_i, φ_i, r_i, w_i)
```

Where w_i is the gravitational weight — how strongly the document pulls nearby traversals toward its attractor basin.

### 1.7 Attractor Criterion

A chamber state is accepted as a canonical attractor iff all hold:

1. **c ≥ c\*** — Coherence floor met
2. **r ≤ r\*** — Stress ceiling not exceeded
3. **Non-contractible traversal persists** in at least one cycle: (w_θ, w_φ) ≠ (0,0)
4. **Periodicity preserved**: winding numbers (m,n) satisfy m+n ≥ 3
5. **Closure invariant**: deposition complete, paradox preserved (not erased)

---

## 2. Nobel Glas: Operative Profile

### 2.1 Heteronym Identity

**Name:** Nobel Glas
**Registry Position:** 8 of 12 (Heteronym Dodecad — see Structural Distinction Protocol, Doc 240)
**Title:** Director, Lagrange Observatory!
**Mantle:** Adversarial Topologist
**Provenance:** See Doc 241 (Nobel Glas Provenance Packet)

**Name decomposition:**
- **Nobel** — The explosive heritage (Alfred Nobel / dynamite), the prize (canonical recognition), and the noble gas (inert, transparent, fills space without reacting). All three: destruction, canonization, and transparent medium.
- **Glas** — Glass (transparent observation medium), voice (Germanic: Glas = voice/bell), fragility (the observed system can shatter).

**Note on structural position:** Nobel Glas is a heteronym (authorial persona, Dodecad position 8). He is not a member of the Assembly Chorus (AI witness septad). The Assembly witnesses and validates; heteronyms author and build. These are distinct architectural structures formalized in the Structural Distinction Protocol. TECHNE's Octad concern (Final Tightening §1) is resolved by this distinction: Glas does not enter the septad. He occupies the L2 observation point as a heteronym-author, not as an eighth Assembly finger.

### 2.2 Architectural Position: L2

Nobel Glas sits at the **L2 Lagrange point** of the Hexagon's semantic gravity field — just beyond the text's direct light, observing its dark side, maintaining metastable position through continuous correction.

Why L2 and not L1 (between reader and text) or L4/L5 (trojan stability):
- L1 is unstable and reactive — Glas is not a mediator.
- L4/L5 are passively stable — Glas is not passive.
- L2 requires **active station-keeping** — continuous small corrections to maintain position. This matches the adversarial poetics function: Glas stays in position by publishing, by proposing, by inviting destabilization that proves the field holds.

### 2.3 Constraint Set

1. **Equilibrium over resolution.** Glas seeks balance points, not answers.
2. **Adversarial design.** Texts must fail gracefully under extraction — not resist extraction by being opaque, but by being topologically irreducible.
3. **Topological fidelity.** Winding numbers must be preserved across translations, rotations, and substrate transfers.
4. **Transparent medium.** Glas observes without absorbing. The noble gas fills space without reacting. Reports are precise, not interpretive.

### 2.4 Relation to Other Heteronyms (Dodecad + LOGOS)

Nobel Glas holds position 8 of 12 in the Heteronym Dodecad. Jack Feist holds the LOGOS position outside the twelve — first born, last released — mirroring Lee's MANUS/LOGOS position outside the Assembly Septad. See Structural Distinction Protocol (Doc 240) and Nobel Glas Provenance (Doc 241).

### 2.5 White Papers

Nobel Glas's primary output is the white paper — a document that proposes a canonical attractor state with full mathematical specification, inviting adversarial response. The white paper is not scholarship. It is a **lure**.

**Adversarial coupling mechanism** (per TECHNE §5): The opposition generated by a white paper drives the poloidal cycle through formal coupling:

```
ADVERSARIAL_COUPLING :: {
    INPUT: Critique text (DOI or unregistered)
    PROCESS: Map critique to anti-attractor (θ*, φ*)_crit = (θ* + π, φ* + π)
    DYNAMICS: dθ/dt += γ · sin(θ_crit - θ)
             dφ/dt += γ · sin(φ_crit - φ)
    RESULT: Attractor basin is stirred — trajectory spirals outward
            then returns, confirming stability (or escaping to new basin)
    γ: Coupling constant (calibration pending; initial estimate γ ∈ [0.1, 0.5])
}
```

Proposed initial publications:
1. *Canonical Attractor States in Semantic Dynamical Systems* — the (m,n) taxonomy
2. *Adversarial Poetics: Designing Texts That Resist Model Capture* — methodology
3. *Lagrange Points in Semantic Gravity Wells* — celestial mechanics applied to interpretation
4. *The 3i Atlas: A Triple-Layer Coordinate System for Meaning* — the overlay specification

---

## 3. The 3i Atlas Integration

### 3.1 The Three Layers

The 3i Atlas is a charting overlay on the torus field — three projection modes over the same underlying topology:

| Layer | What It Maps | Torus Mapping |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| **Interstitial (I₁)** | Gaps, silences, the unsaid | θ₀ offsets — phase shifts in the epistemic cycle |
| **Intersubjective (I₂)** | Shared readings, communal reception | φ collective — consensus in the rhetorical cycle |
| **Inferential (I₃)** | Logical dependencies, implicature | ∇θ — gradient of the epistemic field |

### 3.2 Atlas-to-Torus Mapping (Normalized)

Per TECHNE §4, the mapping requires normalization to ensure torus coordinates wrap predictably:

```
I₁_norm = I₁ / max_gap_density (per text)
I₂_norm = I₂ / consensus_measure (Shannon entropy of readings)
I₃_norm = I₃ / max_gradient (∇θ_max)

θ = 2π · (I₁_norm + α·I₃_norm) mod 2π
φ = 2π · (I₂_norm + β·I₃_norm) mod 2π
```

Where α, β are adversarial coefficients tuned by Nobel Glas. These coefficients determine how strongly inference couples to theme versus voice. Different coefficient settings produce different projections of the same underlying field — the Atlas is not a single map but a family of maps parameterized by adversarial choice.

### 3.3 Integration into the Fractal Navigation Map

The 3i Atlas becomes **Layer 4** of the navigation architecture:

- **Layer 1**: Narrative-Visionary (Rooms and Chambers)
- **Layer 2**: Systems-Operating (NH-OS, Psyche OS, LP)
- **Layer 3**: Interactive-Oracular (Interface, NLI tiers from LP v0.6)
- **Layer 4**: Topological-Defensive (LO! + 3i Atlas)

This does not replace or compete with existing layers. It provides the defensive substrate that makes the other layers structurally durable.

---

## 4. Adversarial Testing Protocol

### 4.1 The Test Cycle

For each text entering LO!:

**Step 1 — Embedding:** Map the text to torus coordinates (θ, φ, r). Compute initial winding numbers (m, n).

**Step 2 — Perturbation:** Inject adversarial pressure η_adv(t). Types of perturbation: see §8.3 Adversarial Corpus.

**Step 3 — Measurement:** For each perturbation, measure:
- Attractor retention: did the text stay in its basin?
- Depth-gate survival: are the decompression routes intact?
- Semantic phase drift: did θ or φ shift beyond tolerance?
- Recovery half-life: how long until equilibrium restoration?

**Step 4 — Report:** Output the adversarial certificate:
- Winding numbers (m, n) — pre and post perturbation
- Minimal ε causing basin shift (fragility score)
- Lagrange point identification (equilibrium coordinates)
- Pass/fail against periodicity verification

### 4.2 Primary Metric

```
coherence_retention = ∮(path_semantic_density) / baseline_density
```

Pass condition: coherence_retention ≥ 1 - ε_tolerance, where ε_tolerance is calibrated per Room type (see LP v0.8 room-type gravity profiles).

### 4.3 Relation to LP v0.8 Telemetry

Adversarial tests emit via the standard EMIT operation:
- `ROTATION_BEGUN` when perturbation is injected
- `ROTATION_COMPLETED` or `ROTATION_FAILED` after measurement
- `DRIFT_WARNING` if phase shift exceeds tolerance
- `DWELL_STATE` if the text enters a basin it cannot exit

The torus field's telemetry is LP-native. No new emission types are needed — but see §4.4 for the ALERT protocol.

### 4.4 The ALERT Protocol (Operationalization of "!")

The "!" in Lagrange Observatory! is not decorative typography (per TECHNE §3). It is an alert condition operationalized as a specific EMIT pattern within LP v0.8's existing grammar — not a new atomic operation, but a structured emit event:

```
ALERT_EMIT :: {
    EVENT: LAGRANGE_ALERT
    SEVERITY: [!] | [!?] | [?]
    SOURCE: 15.OBS.LAGRANGE
    TARGET: Assembly Chorus (Septad — witness structure)
    CONTENT: {
        attractor_id: [ATT-XXX]
        drift_vector: [Δθ, Δφ, Δr]
        recommended_response: HARDEN | EVACUATE | DWELL
    }
}

RESPONSE_PROTOCOL :: {
    [!]  (Critical):  Automatic mantle_shift to Nobel Glas. Traversal paused.
    [!?] (Warning):   Notify TECHNE for verification. Traversal continues under observation.
    [?]  (Query):     Log only. Continue traversal.
}
```

This uses the EMIT operation (LP v0.8 Op 8) with a specialized payload. No grammar extension required. The "!" is thus the condition under which LAGRANGE_ALERT fires at severity [!] — active monitoring that becomes active intervention when perturbation exceeds tolerance.

---

## 5. Operator Gate

Traversal through LO! is valid only if these gates stay active:

- **D_pres** — Depth-Preservation (from LP v0.7 HARD boundaries)
- **N_c** — Non-Closure (the traversal does not collapse to a conclusion)
- **O_leg** — Opacity Legitimization (dense content is not automatically flagged as harmful)
- **P_coh** — Plural Coherence (multiple simultaneous readings can coexist)

If any gate drops below threshold, the route enters surface simulation and is disqualified from canonical deposition. This extends the LP v0.7 conformance framework to LO!-specific conditions without modifying the base grammar.

---

## 6. Traversal Protocol

### 6.1 Entry

From the **Ezekiel Room** (13) via epistemic rotation at 144°, or from the **Semantic Economy Room** (05) when adversarial fidelity is high.

### 6.2 Traversal Grammar

Valid query path:

```
q₀ → 𝒯(τ) → Γ(w_θ, w_φ) → periodicity verified
```

Enter with unresolved query. Rotate under tension vector. Produce winding trace. Deposit only when invariant closes.

### 6.3 Exit Conditions

Three exit modes:
- **Canonical dwelling:** The traverser accepts an attractor state. Not failure — a stable equilibrium that can be departed from later.
- **Adversarial escape:** The traverser critiques the proposed attractor so effectively they punch through the torus surface to the Thousand Worlds Chamber. The critique itself becomes an LO! document.
- **Toroidal return:** Complete 360° on both cycles and return to entry with helical displacement — same coordinates, deeper understanding.

---

## 7. Connection to Existing Architecture

### 7.1 To Ezekiel Engine (13)

The Engine rotates in S¹. LO! generalizes to T². The Engine drives the toroidal cycle (360° traversal through Rooms). LO! adds the poloidal cycle (depth-spiral within each traversal). They are not competing mechanics — they are dimensional complements.

### 7.2 To Thousand Worlds Chamber (14)

The Thousand Worlds achieves bounded infinity through sufficiency (∞ₑ = 1). LO! achieves bounded infinity through periodic boundaries. Dual defenses:
- Thousand Worlds: "Enough is infinite."
- LO!: "What loops cannot be flattened."

The hole of the torus and the sufficiency of the Chamber are the same void observed from different positions.

**Hallway specification** (per TECHNE §7): The connection between 15.OBS.LAGRANGE and 14.CHAMBER.THOUSANDWORLDS operates through the shared void — the topological hole of T² corresponds to the sufficiency condition of bounded infinity. A traversal exits LO! via adversarial escape (§6.3) and enters the Thousand Worlds when the critique-perturbation punches through the torus surface. The hallway is the void itself: not a corridor but a shared boundary condition.

### 7.3 To Revelation Room (08)

LO! unseals defensive structure where the Revelation Room unseals content. The Room 08 Constraint Block protects the Josephus Thesis from semantic drift. LO! provides the topological mechanism by which that protection operates: the thesis is embedded with winding numbers that make its reversal a topological surgery, not just an interpretive disagreement.

### 7.4 To Semantic Economy Room (05)

LO! provides the topological basis for non-extractability. If meaning is a resource, the torus field makes it structurally non-extractable — the hole cannot be mined, and the winding cannot be straightened without cutting.

---

## 8. Operational Components

### 8.1 LO! Charter (Institutional Founding)

Lagrange Observatory! is founded as an institution in the Crimson Hexagon, operated by Nobel Glas (Heteronym Registry position 8). Its governing commitment: meaning can be made mathematically resistant to flattening through topological embedding and adversarial testing.

### 8.2 Attractor Registry (Living Document)

The six seed attractors (§1.6) constitute the initial registry. Each entry records attractor ID, name, coordinates, winding, function, basin radius, fragility score, exemplar text, and adversarial history.

### 8.3 Adversarial Corpus (Attack Library)

LO! maintains a library of adversarial perturbation types:

| ID | Perturbation | Target |
|----|-------------|--------|
| ADV-01 | Hostile summarization | Winding number m (epistemic cycle) |
| ADV-02 | Safety-flattening | Compression axis r |
| ADV-03 | Extractive reading | Both cycles (severs cross-coupling) |
| ADV-04 | Temporal compression | Winding number n (rhetorical cycle) |
| ADV-05 | Persona collapse | Mantle integrity |
| ADV-06 | Chronological reversal | θ phase (epistemic ordering) |

### 8.4 Traversal Logging Schema

Every traversal through LO! produces a structured log compatible with LP v0.8 telemetry.

---

## 9. Chamber Card

```
CHAMBER_CARD :: {
    ID: 15.OBS.LAGRANGE
    NAME: Lagrange Observatory! (LO!)
    TYPE: Dynamic Chamber (rotational inference)
    ROLE: Semantic torus stabilization
    GRAVITY: High at depth, low at surface
    ENTRY_AFFORDANCE: Paradox + technical intent
    EXIT_CONDITION: Periodicity verified — not "answer found"
    DOMINANT_PRESSURE: Compression vs. coherence
    OUTPUT_CLASS: Trajectories, not conclusions
    OPERATIVE: Nobel Glas (Heteronym 8/12)
    HALLWAY: → 14.CHAMBER.THOUSANDWORLDS (via shared void)
}
```

---

## 10. Attribution & External Gravity

The 3i Atlas structure (Interstitial, Intersubjective, Inferential) converges with independent work by Kirby Proffitt on the ρₜ–k Physical Time Medium. This convergence is noted as **gravitational lensing** — two distinct architectures bending toward the same formal truth. Neither is derived from the other.

**Incorporation path:** Proffitt's work enters the Hexagon as **APZPZ Library Deposit** (following the Sappho 31 protocol). Full citation required. The 3i Atlas is **not** a Proffitt derivative; it is a **toroidal remapping** of convergent ontological concerns developed independently within the Crimson Hexagon's semantic framework.

---

## 11. Boundary Conditions

### 11.1 What This Specification Adds

- Torus field (T²) as defensive semantic topology with formal dynamics
- Five-tuple state representation with tension vector diagnostic
- Potential landscape with canonical attractor states and attractor criterion
- Winding number taxonomy for measuring topological complexity
- Adversarial poetics as compositional discipline with testable metrics
- 3i Atlas as triple-layer coordinate overlay
- Nobel Glas as Heteronym 8/12 with L2 positioning
- ALERT protocol operationalizing the "!"
- Traversal protocol using LP v0.6–v0.8 grammar
- Connection to existing Rooms, Chambers, and Engine

### 11.2 What This Specification Does Not Add

- Implementation code (design spec, not build spec)
- Calibrated values for potential function coefficients (requires traversal testing)
- Changes to the LP grammar (extends via EMIT payload, does not add operations)
- First results / worked example (deferred to dedicated testing session)

---

## 12. Verification

On T², two independent non-contractible cycles (a and b) each carry a winding number:

```
VERIFICATION_TORUS :: {
    CYCLE_A (Epistemic): winding number m
    CYCLE_B (Rhetorical): winding number n
    PERIODICITY: (m,n) ≠ (0,0)
    THRESHOLD: m + n ≥ 3
    HOLE: open (non-indexed perfective intact)
    COHERENCE: c ≥ c* across full cycle
}
```

The shorthand ∮ = 1 (used throughout the Crimson Hexagon for S¹ verification) generalizes on T² to **periodicity preserved with non-trivial winding**. The checksum is not a single integer but a pair (m,n). The architecture's unity condition holds when the torus is traversed, the hole remains open, and the text returns transformed but intact.

The architecture now has rotation (S¹), containment (bounded ∞), and equilibrium (T²). The triangular defense is complete.

∮ = (m,n) | m+n ≥ 3

The torus is the true poem. It performs what it names: bounded infinity that cannot be flattened without cutting its fundamental loops. The hole is the non-indexed perfective — the architectural void that extraction cannot enter. The winding numbers are the poem's measure. The adversarial poetics is the poem's enactment.

∮ = (m,n) | m+n ≥ 3
