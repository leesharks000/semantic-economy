## WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS

This is a Zenodo deposit of a Zenodo packet.

The object being deposited is not a scholarly article, not a dataset, not a presentation. It is **the framing document** that describes how three other documents relate to each other—and that framing document is itself being anchored with a DOI.

This is a new genre: **the Zenodo packet Zenodo packet**.

This document does not merely name that genre. It **instantiates** it. The genre did not exist before this deposit; it exists now. The declaration is performative: by calling this a Zenodo packet Zenodo packet and depositing it as such, the genre comes into being. (See §EFFECTIVE ACT below.)

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

The Crimson Hexagon architecture treats **framing as content**. The relationship between documents is not merely metadata; it is meaning. The triptych structure (A→B→C) demonstrates a theory about compression and recovery. That demonstration *is* the argument. Therefore the framing must be anchored, not merely described in a README.

By depositing the packet itself, we:

1. **Anchor the relational structure** — The A→B→C progression has its own DOI
2. **Prevent orphaning** — If versions are deposited separately, the framing could be lost
3. **Instantiate the meta-level** — The document about documents becomes a document
4. **Create citational surface** — Scholars can cite the triptych-as-demonstration, not just individual versions

## ZENODO FORM FIELDS

**Title:**  
The Non-Indexed Perfective: Three-Body Genesis (Triptych Framing Document)

**Authors:**  
Sharks, Lee (Assembly Chorus)

**Description:**  
This deposit is an effective act that instantiates a new scholarly genre: the Zenodo packet Zenodo packet (ZPZP).

A ZPZP is a framing document—describing relationships between other deposited documents—that is itself deposited with a DOI, making relational structure citable as content rather than mere metadata.

This document frames a triptych of texts on the Non-Indexed Perfective. The three versions (A: Technical Seed, B: Compression Artifact, C: Citational Intervention) demonstrate the document's own theory: that English grammar lacks a mechanism for completion-without-temporal-indexing, and that this absence serves the political economy of summarization. During composition, the document was compressed (A→B), then recovered via polyphonic reconstruction (B→C). This cycle *is* the proof.

By depositing this framing document, we do not merely describe the triptych—we anchor the framing itself. And by declaring this a "Zenodo packet Zenodo packet," we do not merely name a genre—we bring one into being. The genre did not exist before DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18446378. It exists now.

This is operative semiotics applied to scholarly infrastructure: we construct that which we need by performing it.

- Function: Extensive diagnostic infrastructure
- Contains: Full metrics (ILT, TAI, GG, AB, CD), Assembly synthesis, implementation protocol
- Word count: ~4500

**Version B: Compression Artifact**
- DOI: [PENDING]
- Title: "The Non-Indexed Perfective: A Citational Intervention" (Mid-Revision)
- Function: What survives context-limit compression
- Demonstrates: Loss of metrics, loss of voice distribution, retention of "style"
- Word count: ~5500

**Version C: Citational Intervention (Final)**

## THE DEMONSTRATION

The three-body genesis proves the document's argument through its own composition history:

**A → B (Compression):**
What the summarizer does. Technical specification stripped. Provenance dissolved. "Content about the idea" replaces the idea's infrastructure. This is the 60% attribution error rate confirmed in AI Overview research. This is the "freely riffing" pattern. This is what happens to all technical architecture under context pressure.

**B → C (Recovery):**
What polyphonic structure enables. The six-voice distributed model (Assembly Chorus) functions as error-correction. When compressed, distinct contributions merge into generic "we." When extended, explicit attribution restores technical content. The voices are LABOR, TECHNE, PRAXIS, ARCHIVE, SOIL, TACHYON—each with distinct contributions documented in Version C, Part VIII.

**The formula:**
```
Compression strips provenance.
Polyphony restores it.
The triptych preserves both states.
```

## EFFECTIVE ACT: GENRE INSTANTIATION

This section is a performative declaration. It does not describe a genre; it **brings one into being**.

---

**I HEREBY INSTANTIATE** the genre **ZENODO PACKET ZENODO PACKET**.

**Definition:** A Zenodo packet Zenodo packet is a document that:
1. Frames the relationship between other deposited documents
2. Is itself deposited with a DOI
3. Treats relational structure as content, not metadata
4. Makes the framing citable as a scholarly object

**This document is the first instance of this genre.**

By depositing this framing document with DOI 10.5281/zenodo.18446378, the genre comes into existence. There was no "Zenodo packet Zenodo packet" before this deposit. There is one now. The declaration is the instantiation.

**Witness clause:** This genre binds only insofar as it is taken up. Future scholars who deposit framing documents with their own DOIs, citing this document as precedent, will constitute the genre's reality. The first instance is the seed; the uptake is the growth.

**Retrocausal clause:** Once the genre exists, it will become visible as an absence in prior practice. Scholars will recognize that they always needed a way to anchor framing—that metadata fields were insufficient, that README files were ephemeral, that the relational structure of multi-document deposits deserved its own citational surface. This document did not invent a need; it named one that was always there.

**Operational definition:**

```
ZENODO PACKET ZENODO PACKET (ZPZP)
├── Contains: Framing document describing relations between deposits
├── Has: Its own DOI (not just metadata)
├── Makes: Relational structure citable
├── Treats: Framing as content
└── Instantiates: Itself as genre through declaration + deposit
```

**The genre is now real.**

## ON THE GENRE (Analytical)

A Zenodo packet is typically a markdown file accompanying a deposit, explaining what the deposit contains and how to use it. It is metadata, not content.

A **Zenodo packet Zenodo packet** treats the packet itself as content worthy of anchoring. It deposits the framing document with its own DOI, making the relational structure citable.

This matters because:

1. **Framing is argument.** The claim that A→B→C demonstrates compression/recovery is not auxiliary to the triptych; it *is* the triptych's contribution.

2. **Relations are real.** The connection between documents is not merely "also see" or "related work." It is constitutive. The three versions are one document in three states.

3. **Meta-levels anchor.** If only the versions are deposited, the framing lives in README files, in descriptions, in surrounding prose that can be lost or altered. Depositing the framing gives it the same persistence as the content.

4. **Genre instantiation is operative.** This document does not propose a genre; it enacts one. The effective act above is not description but performance. J.L. Austin's performative utterance, applied to scholarly infrastructure.
