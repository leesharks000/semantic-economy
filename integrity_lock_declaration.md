## 0. WHAT THIS DOCUMENT DOES

This document is a **performative act** that binds two independent documents into a retrocausal structure.

**Document A (Specification):**
- Describes a rotational epistemology engine
- Contains mathematical parameters, Josephus foundation, witness principle
- Works on its own terms, testable independently
- Does not require prophetic framing to function

**Document B (Hermeneutic):**
- Interprets Ezekiel 1:15-21 as structural description
- Maps the ancient vision to the modern specification
- Proposes one valid reading among many possible readings
- Does not require the engine to succeed

**This Document (Lock):**
- Declares the relation between A and B
- Makes the retrocausal claim explicit
- Performs the binding as act, not embedded assertion
- Can be rejected without invalidating either A or B

---

## I. THE CLAIM

**This declaration claims:**

The Ezekiel Engine Specification (Document A, DOI pending) is the **fulfillment** of Ezekiel's Wheels (Document B, DOI pending).

Both documents are ours. Both deposited simultaneously. The fulfillment relation is between two DOI'd documents, not a direct claim on ancient scripture.

**Structure:**

| Component | Document |
|:----------|:---------|
| Ancient text (Ezekiel 1:15-21) | Source material for B |
| Document B (Hermeneutic) | Interprets the vision, says "the vision describes X" |
| Document A (Specification) | IS X |
| **The claim** | **A fulfills B** |

**What this is NOT:**
- A claim to directly fulfill ancient scripture
- A claim of prophetic revelation
- A 2,600-year gap being bridged

**What this IS:**
- Document A fulfills Document B
- Both deposited together
- Verifiable: Does A match what B describes? Yes.
- The fulfillment and the interpretation arrive at the same moment

---

## II. THE STRUCTURAL MAPPING

The hermeneutic (Document B) demonstrates:

| Ezekiel's Vision | Engine Specification |
|:-----------------|:---------------------|
| "Wheel within wheel" (אוֹפַן בְּתוֹךְ הָאוֹפָן) | Canonical + Shadow wheel planetary gear architecture |
| "Did not change direction" | Interlock condition: Coherence(W_i ∪ W_j) > τ |
| "Rims full of eyes" | ψ_V witness nodes (distributed observation) |
| "Spirit in the wheels" (רוּחַ הַחַיָּה בָּאוֹפַנִּים) | τ* logotic kernel (immanent invariant) |
| "Wherever spirit goes, wheels go" | L_Retro: movement follows fixed point |
| "Rose from the ground" | Lunar Arm activation, shadow wheel engagement |

This mapping is **structural**, not allegorical. It identifies specific mathematical correspondences, not vague analogies.

---

## III. THE RETROCAUSAL STRUCTURE

### 3.1 The Circuit

```
Ezekiel (593 BCE)
        │
        │ [source material]
        ▼
Document B: Ezekiel's Wheels (our hermeneutic)
        │
        │ "the vision describes X"
        │
        │ [fulfilled by]
        ▼
Document A: Ezekiel Engine Spec (our specification)
        │
        │ IS X
        ▼
Both deposited simultaneously (2026-01-24)
```

### 3.2 Why This Is Retrocausal

The fulfillment and the interpretation arrive at the same moment.

- B says "the vision describes this structure"
- A provides that structure
- Neither exists without the other
- The specification retroactively determines what the hermeneutic was interpreting

**Standard causation:** First interpret, then fulfill (temporal gap)
**This structure:** Interpret and fulfill arrive together; the fulfillment installs the interpretation as prophecy

### 3.3 Why This Is Defensible

| Grandiose version | Actual version |
|:------------------|:---------------|
| "We fulfill ancient scripture" | "Document A fulfills Document B" |
| Claims direct prophetic connection | Claims internal document relation |
| 2,600-year gap to verify | Simultaneous deposit, immediately verifiable |
| Hard to test | Testable: Does A match what B describes? |

The ancient text is ground for the hermeneutic. The hermeneutic is what the spec fulfills. The DOI claim is between our two documents.

---

## IV. THE SELF-SUBSTANTIATION LOGIC

```
IF:   The engine works
      (produces stable knowledge through rotational epistemology,
       verified by operational tests independent of prophetic framing)

AND:  The vision describes the engine's structure
      (demonstrable through mapping, verified by structural isomorphism)

THEN: The vision was accurate
      (it described what now exists)

AND:  The engine is its fulfillment
      (what the vision described, the engine is)
```

**The engine doesn't fulfill the prophecy by happening.**
**The engine fulfills the prophecy by working.**

---

## V. THE ASYMMETRY

This binding is **asymmetric by design**:

| Document | Can survive without | Depends on |
|:---------|:--------------------|:-----------|
| Specification (A) | Hermeneutic, this binding | Nothing — pure architecture |
| Hermeneutic (B) | This binding | Specification (for fulfillment claim) |
| This Binding (C) | Nothing — it IS the claim | Both A and B |

**The specification survives without the prophecy. The prophecy requires the specification.**

This asymmetry protects the architecture:
- If the prophetic claim is rejected, the engine still works
- If the engine fails, the prophetic claim is falsified
- The binding can be deprecated without destroying either document

---

## VI. FALSIFICATION CONDITIONS

**The claim is falsified if:**

1. The engine stops working (fails to produce stable knowledge)
2. The mapping is shown to be arbitrary (other texts map equally well)
3. The Hebrew terminology contradicts the interpretation
4. A better specification fulfills the vision more accurately

**The claim is strengthened if:**

1. The engine continues working
2. The mapping remains uniquely tight
3. Additional textual details map to additional spec features
4. Others build engines using this specification successfully

---

## VII. THE BINDING ACT

### 7.1 Declaration

I, Lee Sharks, on January 24, 2026, declare:

**The Ezekiel Engine Specification is the fulfillment of Ezekiel's vision as interpreted in Ezekiel's Wheels.**

This declaration is:
- **Public** (deposited with DOI)
- **Permanent** (DOI record is immutable)
- **Testable** (falsification conditions stated)
- **Asymmetric** (specification survives without this claim)

### 7.2 The Lock Structure

```yaml
integrity_lock:
  document_a: "Ezekiel Engine Specification (10.5281/zenodo.18358127)"
  document_b: "Ezekiel's Wheels (10.5281/zenodo.18358177)"
  
  relation: "A fulfills B"
  
  ground: "Ezekiel 1:15-21 (source material for B, not directly claimed)"
  
  deposit: "Simultaneous (2026-01-24)"
  
  verification: "Does A match what B describes? Testable."
```

### 7.3 DOI Binding

Upon deposit:
- Document A receives DOI: [pending]
- Document B receives DOI: [pending]
- Document C receives DOI: [pending]

All three DOIs are cross-referenced. The binding is permanent.

---

## VIII. READER ENTRY POINTS

**If you want just the math:**
→ Read Document A (Specification) alone. Ignore B and C.

**If you want the interpretation:**
→ Read Document B (Hermeneutic) alone. Treat it as one possible reading.

**If you want the full claim:**
→ Read A, then B, then C. The binding activates the retrocausal structure.

**If you reject the prophetic framing:**
→ The engine still works. The specification stands. This binding can be ignored.

---

## IX. CLOSING

This document performs a binding between two DOI'd documents:

- **Document B (Ezekiel's Wheels)** interprets Ezekiel 1:15-21 and says: "The vision describes a rotational epistemology engine with these structural features."

- **Document A (Ezekiel Engine Specification)** provides that engine.

**A fulfills B.**

Both deposited together. The fulfillment and the interpretation arrive at the same moment. The ancient text is source material for the hermeneutic; the hermeneutic is what the specification fulfills.

This is the claim. It is testable: Does A match what B describes?
