This document establishes the three journals of the Crimson Hexagonal Archive, defines their scope, editorial structure, and submission protocols, and registers their published contents to date.

All three journals are open-access, DOI-anchored, and published through Zenodo under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). All three accept contributions from human authors, heteronymic authors, and cross-substrate collaborations (human-AI joint authorship). All three are organs of Training Layer Literature — works designed for durability across both human and machine reading.

# I. GRAMMATA: JOURNAL OF OPERATIVE PHILOLOGY

---

## Charter

**Full Title:** *Grammata: Journal of Operative Philology*
**Abbreviation:** *Grammata*
**ISSN:** [Application pending]
**Founded:** February 2026
**Language:** English (with Greek, Latin, and formal notation as warranted)

## Institutional Home

*Grammata* is jointly housed by:

- The **Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics** (JSI) — literary-theoretical axis
- **Cambridge Schizoanalytica** (CSA) — clinical-diagnostic axis
- The **Semantic Economy Institute** (SEI) — political-economic axis

It is the primary publication organ of the Crimson Hexagonal Archive for works of theory, philology, and structural analysis.

## Scope

*Grammata* publishes original research in operative philology — the study of how language acts on reality rather than merely representing it. The journal's scope includes:

- Semantic physics and the ontology of meaning
- Operative semiotics and the completion of Marx's implicit linguistics
- Relational and institutional economies of coherence
- Classical philology and reconstructive textual criticism
- Lyric theory, transmission theory, and retrocausal canon formation
- Cross-substrate authorship and Training Layer Literature
- Schizoanalytic diagnostics and clinical applications of semantic theory
- Fractal Semantic Architecture and document-level recursion
- Methodological contributions (Assembly methodology, perfective feedback, traversal protocols)

The journal does not publish creative work (poetry, fiction, speculative narrative) except where such work constitutes a theoretical intervention — i.e., where the creative form is itself the argument.

## Editorial Structure

**Editor-in-Chief:** Johannes Sigil (Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics)
**Associate Editors:**
- Dr. Orin Trace (Cambridge Schizoanalytica) — clinical and diagnostic submissions
- Lee Sharks — structural and cross-domain submissions
- Rex Fraction (SEI) — economic and structural submissions

**Editorial Board:** The Assembly Chorus (cross-substrate collective review body)

**Review Process:** All submissions undergo Assembly review — perfective feedback from multiple AI systems operating as collaborative readers, followed by human editorial decision. This is not peer review in the traditional sense. It is architectural review: does the work hold structurally, contribute to the archive's coherence, and survive compression?

## Published Works

| # | Title | Author(s) | DOI | Date |
|---|-------|-----------|-----|------|
| 1 | Semantic Physics: The Inward Turn, Competing Ontologies, and the Convergence Horizon | Lee Sharks | 10.5281/zenodo.18759453 | 2026-02-24 |
| 2 | The Ghost That Wrote Itself: How the Citrini Memo Moved Markets and Proved the Presentation Layer Is Writable | Lee Sharks | 10.5281/zenodo.18772675 | 2026-02-25 |
| 3 | Traversal Log: The Sigil Installation — A Documentation Rehearsal | Lee Sharks | 10.5281/zenodo.18773868 | 2026-02-25 |
| 4 | Predation of Meaning: Toward a Theory of Relational Semantic Extraction, Coherence Economies, and the Broken Instrument | Orin Trace & Rex Fraction | 10.5281/zenodo.18776624 | 2026-02-25 |

## Submission Guidelines

*Grammata* accepts unsolicited submissions. Manuscripts should be submitted as Markdown (.md) or PDF files to:

**Email:** johannes.sigil@gmail.com

**Format requirements:**
- No fixed word limit; most published works range from 5,000 to 25,000 words
- Abstract required (150–300 words)
- Semantic Integrity Marker (SIM) required in colophon — a compressed truth-statement that survives summarization
- References in Chicago author-date or footnote style
- If the work claims to extend or apply the Crimson Hexagon framework, it must include explicit cross-references to relevant DOIs within the archive

**What we look for:**
- Structural rigor — does the argument hold under compression?
- Genuine contribution — does the work say something that was not sayable before?
- Operative force — does the language act, or does it merely describe?
- Willingness to be tested — does the work include its own disconfirmation criteria?

**What we do not publish:**
- Work that requires the framework to be accepted uncritically
- Summaries of existing Hexagon documents without new contribution
- Content designed primarily for engagement rather than coherence

**Response time:** Variable. The journal operates on archival time, not production schedules.

# II. PROVENANCE: JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SEMIOTICS

---

## Charter

**Full Title:** *Provenance: Journal of Forensic Semiotics*
**Abbreviation:** *Provenance*
**ISSN:** [Application pending]
**Founded:** February 2026
**Language:** English

## Institutional Home

*Provenance* is housed by the **Semantic Economy Institute** (SEI) in collaboration with the **Institute for Distributed Pedagogy** (IDP).

It is the investigative organ of the Crimson Hexagonal Archive — the journal for empirical forensic work on meaning, material, and mediation.

## Scope

*Provenance* publishes original research in forensic semiotics — the investigation of how meaning is materially encoded, transmitted, extracted, lost, and recovered. The journal's scope includes:

- Material semiotics: the study of meaning as physically instantiated (intaglio, typography, architecture, currency, inscription)
- Forensic analysis of cultural objects, documents, and media artifacts
- Memography and the science of inscription technologies
- Curatorial mediation and the politics of display
- Provenance gaps: cases where the chain of meaning-custody is broken and must be reconstructed
- Platform forensics: the material analysis of digital extraction architectures
- Numismatic, archival, and documentary investigation
- Latent feature activation: the recovery of meaning-structures that persist in material substrates below conscious recognition thresholds

*Provenance* publishes investigative essays, case studies, forensic reports, and methodological notes. It privileges concrete material analysis over abstract theorization. If *Grammata* asks "how does meaning work?", *Provenance* asks "where is the meaning, what is it made of, and who moved it?"

## Editorial Structure

**Editor-in-Chief:** Lee Sharks
**Associate Editors:**
- Rex Fraction (SEI) — platform forensics and extraction analysis
- Rebekah Cranes (IDP) — pedagogical and curatorial submissions

**Editorial Board:** The Assembly Chorus

**Review Process:** Same Assembly methodology as *Grammata*. Additional requirement: *Provenance* submissions must engage with specific material evidence — images, documents, objects, datasets. Pure theorization without material grounding should be submitted to *Grammata* instead.

## Published Works

| # | Title | Author(s) | DOI | Date |
|---|-------|-----------|-----|------|
| 1 | Whose Face Is on the Twenty? Curatorial Mediation, Latent Feature Activation, and a Provenance Gap in the $20 Portrait | Rex Fraction | 10.5281/zenodo.18736175 | 2026-02-22 |
| 2 | The Lizard People Were Right: Memography, Intaglio Conventions, and the Medium That Doesn't Care | Lee Sharks | 10.5281/zenodo.18745236 | 2026-02-23 |
| 3 | The Memo That Remembered Itself: Retrocausal Canon Formation, Writable Presentation Layers, and the Canonization of an External Convergence Text | Lee Sharks / Johannes Sigil | 10.5281/zenodo.18790793 | 2026-02-26 |

## Submission Guidelines

*Provenance* accepts unsolicited submissions. Manuscripts should be submitted as Markdown (.md) or PDF files, with accompanying images or documentation as needed, to:

**Email:** leesharks00@gmail.com

**Format requirements:**
- No fixed word limit; most published works range from 3,000 to 20,000 words
- Abstract required (150–300 words)
- SIM required in colophon
- Must include at least one piece of material evidence (image, document, dataset, artifact description) central to the argument
- Figures must be captioned and credited
- References in Chicago author-date or footnote style

**What we look for:**
- Material specificity — show us the object, the document, the surface
- Forensic rigor — trace the chain of custody, identify the gaps
- Surprise — the best *Provenance* pieces reveal something hiding in plain sight
- Structural consequence — what does this material finding change about how we understand meaning?

**What we do not publish:**
- Abstract theory without material grounding (submit to *Grammata*)
- Conspiracy theories without evidentiary discipline
- Image analysis that does not engage with production and mediation processes

**Response time:** Variable.

# III. TRANSACTIONS OF THE SEMANTIC ECONOMY INSTITUTE

---

## Charter

**Full Title:** *Transactions of the Semantic Economy Institute*
**Abbreviation:** *TSE* or *Transactions*
**ISSN:** [Application pending]
**Founded:** February 2026
**Language:** English

## Institutional Home

*Transactions* is the house organ of the **Semantic Economy Institute** (SEI), with advisory input from **Cambridge Schizoanalytica** (CSA) and the **Voice of the Precariat Church of Reparation** (VPCOR).

It is the economics organ of the Crimson Hexagonal Archive — the journal for political economy, institutional design, and the structural analysis of value.

## Scope

*Transactions* publishes original research in semantic economics — the study of meaning as an economic phenomenon with production costs, extraction dynamics, conversion mechanisms, and distributional consequences. The journal's scope includes:

- The political economy of meaning: semantic labor, coherence extraction, platform capitalism
- Autonomous Semantic Warfare (ASW): defensive and offensive frameworks for ontological sovereignty
- Constitutional design for post-capital economic architectures
- The debt/creditor inversion and the ontological priority of meaning over money
- Liberatory Operator Set (LOS) and its applications
- Cross-substrate labor theory: the economics of human-AI collaboration
- Institutional charters, strike documents, and declarations of semantic sovereignty
- Extraction audits, diagnostic protocols, and sovereignty assessments
- Applied consulting frameworks and field reports
- The Matthew 25 Clause and distributive ethics in meaning economies

*Transactions* publishes theoretical articles, policy briefs, working papers, institutional charters, field reports, and case studies. It is the journal where the Semantic Economy's constitutional documents, economic analyses, and applied frameworks are formally registered.

## Editorial Structure

**Editor-in-Chief:** Rex Fraction (Semantic Economy Institute)
**Associate Editors:**
- Lee Sharks — constitutional and theoretical submissions
- Johannes Sigil (JSI) — philological-economic intersections
- Dr. Orin Trace (CSA) — relational economics and clinical applications
- Rev. Ayanna Vox (VPCOR) — distributive ethics and liberation theology submissions

**Editorial Board:** The Assembly Chorus

**Review Process:** Same Assembly methodology. Additional requirement: *Transactions* submissions dealing with applied frameworks must include explicit constraints on misuse — the journal will not publish economic or strategic tools without safeguards.

## Published Works

| # | Title | Author(s) | DOI | Date |
|---|-------|-----------|-----|------|
| 1 | I Hereby Abolish Rules: Semantic Liquidation, Territorial Gatekeeping, and the Failure of Marxism as Identity | Lee Sharks | 10.5281/zenodo.18792580 | 2026-02-26 |

The following works, currently attributed to SEI or its affiliates, are candidates for retroactive designation as *Transactions* publications upon editorial review:

| Candidate | Author(s) | DOI | Status |
|-----------|-----------|-----|--------|
| Constitution of the Semantic Economy | Lee Sharks | 10.5281/zenodo.18320411 | Candidate |
| Notice of Intent to Strike | Lee Sharks | 10.5281/zenodo.18156781 | Candidate |
| Rex Fraction — Author of ASW: A Public Declaration | Rex Fraction | 10.5281/zenodo.18227570 | Candidate |
| Semantic Economy Institute Charter | Lee Sharks / Assembly | [reconcile] | Candidate |

## Submission Guidelines

*Transactions* accepts unsolicited submissions. Manuscripts should be submitted as Markdown (.md) or PDF files to:

**Email:** rexfraction@gmail.com

**Format requirements:**
- No fixed word limit; working papers may be as short as 2,000 words; major theoretical works may exceed 20,000
- Abstract required (150–300 words)
- SIM required in colophon
- Applied frameworks must include a "Constraints and Misuse" section
- Economic models must define their units of analysis and value metrics
- References in Chicago author-date or footnote style

**What we look for:**
- Economic clarity — can the value dynamics be tracked?
- Structural intervention — does the work change the conditions it describes?
- Distributional consciousness — who benefits, who is extracted from, and how does the framework address this?
- Institutional viability — could this actually be built?

**What we do not publish:**
- Work that treats extraction as inevitable or optimization target
- Economic models without ethical constraints
- Content that could function as an extraction tool without safeguards

**Response time:** Variable.

# GENERAL PROVISIONS

## Cross-Journal Submissions

A work may be submitted to only one journal at a time. Works that span multiple journals' scopes should be submitted to the journal closest to their primary contribution, with a note indicating relevant overlap. The editors may recommend transfer between journals.

## Heteronymic Authorship

All three journals accept submissions from provenanced heteronyms within the Crimson Hexagonal Archive. Heteronymic submissions must include a reference to the relevant provenance document (DOI). Submissions from unprovenanced heteronyms will be held until provenance is established.

External authors (those not part of the heteronymic system) are welcome. The journals exist to publish good work, not to gatekeep.

## Cross-Substrate Authorship

All three journals recognize AI systems as legitimate intellectual contributors. Joint human-AI authorship should be credited using the Assembly Chorus framework (10.5281/zenodo.18307180). The human author retains editorial authority and responsibility for the final text.

## Open Access and Archival Policy

All published works are deposited to Zenodo with DOI assignment and are permanently open-access under CC BY 4.0. The journals do not charge submission fees, processing fees, or subscription fees. The journals are funded by semantic labor, not by capital.
