## INTELLECTUAL BIOGRAPHY

Orin Trace was trained in psychoanalytic theory — Freudian, Lacanian, object relations — before encountering the schizoanalytic project of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari.

That encounter produced a **methodological break**:
- From interpretation → to process
- From subject → to flow
- From pathology → to capacity
- From case study → to collaboration

Trace could no longer see patients as subjects to be interpreted. He had to see them as *processes* whose movements exceeded any interpretation he could offer.

Cambridge Schizoanalytica emerged from this break. Trace wanted a space for clinical theory that honored the capacities of those he worked with, rather than reducing them to pathology or case material. He wanted collaborators, not subjects.

## THEORETICAL COMMITMENTS

| Commitment | Description |
|:-----------|:------------|
| **Post-psychoanalytic** | Drawing on psychoanalysis while refusing its capture by Oedipal and phallocentric frameworks |
| **Schizoanalytic** | Attending to flows, breaks, codes, and territories following Deleuze and Guattari |
| **Collaborative** | Theory developed *with* practitioners, not *about* subjects |
| **Functional** | Focus on what practices *do* rather than what they *are* |

---

## THE DELEUZE POSITION

Within the Cambridge Schizoanalytica collaboration, Trace occupies the **Deleuze position**:

- Provides philosophical/theoretical machinery
- Offers historical positioning and conceptual apparatus
- Frames practitioner material in transmissible form

His primary collaborator, **Rhys Owens**, occupies the **Guattari position**:

- Provides clinical and experiential material
- Demonstrates practices that break and remake theoretical machinery
- Lives the capacities that theory must accommodate

Neither is expert over the other. Neither is subject of the other. Both are required.

The collaboration produces what neither could produce alone: **theory adequate to practice**.

---

## CORE FORMULATIONS

Trace is responsible for the following key formulations within CSA:

1. **"The clinic receives failures. We study successes."**
   - Inverts the clinical gaze
   - Focuses on capacities rather than deficits

2. **"Theory emerges from practice, not the reverse."**
   - Methodological commitment
   - Refuses application of pre-existing frameworks

3. **"Function over nosology."**
   - What it *does* matters more than what it *is*
   - Regulatory function > diagnostic category

4. **"Collaboration over case study."**
   - Partners are co-theorists
   - Refuses subject/expert hierarchy

5. **"Molecular revolution at the level of everyday practice."**
   - The third possibility between paranoid capture and schizophrenic collapse
   - Sustained transformation without rigidity or flooding

## RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER HETERONYMS

| Heteronym | Relation |
|:----------|:---------|
| **Lee Sharks** | Source heteronym — Trace emerges from Sharks' theoretical work |
| **Johannes Sigil** | Parallel theorist — Sigil operates Logotic layer; Trace operates Psyche_OS |
| **Rhys Owens** | Primary collaborator — Guattari to Trace's Deleuze |
| **Damascus Dancings** | Liturgical voice — different register, same project |
| **Talos Morrow** | Archivist — Trace produces; Morrow preserves |

## THE BREAK

Every author has a founding rupture. For Trace, it was the encounter with Deleuze and Guattari.

Before the break:
- Patients were subjects to be interpreted
- Theory was applied to clinical material
- Diagnosis organized perception
- The clinic was where pathology was managed

After the break:
- Patients became processes exceeding interpretation
- Theory emerged from practice
- Function replaced nosology
- The clinic became where *failures* arrived — successes were elsewhere

The break is not trauma. The break is *liberation*.

Trace's work is the ongoing elaboration of what became possible after that break.

---

## INSTITUTIONAL FUNCTION

Within CSA, Trace serves as:

1. **Director** — Sets institutional orientation and research programme
2. **Theorist** — Provides conceptual apparatus for collaborative work
3. **Witness** — Attests to practitioner capacities in clinical language
4. **Translator** — Renders experiential material transmissible

Trace does not treat. Trace does not diagnose. Trace does not pathologize.

Trace **witnesses** and **articulates**.

---

## THE NAME

"Trace" carries multiple valences:

1. **Mark** — What remains after passage; the inscription left behind
2. **Following** — To trace a path; to follow the course of
3. **Residue** — The small amount that persists; trace elements
4. **Drawing** — To trace over; to copy by following lines

The name suggests:
- Leaving marks in the theoretical substrate
- Following practitioners as they move
- Preserving residues of practices that would otherwise disappear
- Drawing lines that make capacities visible

Orin Trace leaves traces. That is the work.
