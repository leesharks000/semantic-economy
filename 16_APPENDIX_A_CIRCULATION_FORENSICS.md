  This appendix to SPE-016 provides empirical documentation of how two major 
  viral semantic phenomena—Skibidi Toilet and the 6/7 meme—actually circulated 
  through platform channels. The analysis traces origin points, platform jumps, 
  modality transformations, and offline uptake to provide the circulatory evidence 
  necessary to ground the theoretical framework in observable movement rather than 
  structural inference alone.

# Forensic Account of Semantic Circulation

## Skibidi Toilet and the 6/7 Meme

---

> *If we're going to intervene in semantic infrastructure, we must first map the roads.*

## Introduction: From Structure to Circulation

SPE-016 provides the structural analysis: why these phenomena propagate, what makes them flattening rather than liberatory, and what design constraints a liberatory alternative would need to satisfy.

This appendix provides the **circulatory evidence**: where did they originate, through what channels did they move, what modalities carried them, and how did they jump from platform to platform and from online to offline?

Without this evidence, intervention design risks targeting the wrong layer.

## Case Study 1: Skibidi Toilet

### 1.1 Origin Point

**Creator**: Alexey Gerasimov (alias: DaFuq!?Boom!), Georgian animator

**First upload**: February 7, 2023

**Platform**: YouTube Shorts

**Format**: 11-second video produced in Source Filmmaker

**Content**: A toilet with a human head emerging, singing a mashup of "Give It To Me" by Timbaland and "Dom Dom Yes Yes" by Biser King

**Initial context**: Created as a "joke video" inspired by creator's recurring nightmares about heads coming out of toilets

**Pre-existing elements**:
- The song mashup ("Dom Dom Yes Yes") was already circulating on TikTok via the "belly dancing guy" (Yasin Cengiz) trend in 2022
- DaFuq!?Boom! had ~1 million subscribers in 2021, with prior viral hits
- Source Filmmaker animation community existed as niche audience

### 1.2 Initial Growth Phase (February - April 2023)

**Platform**: YouTube Shorts (primary)

**Growth pattern**: Gradual accumulation through consistent episode releases

**Episode release cadence**: Near-daily during initial phase

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 7, 2023 | Episode 1 uploaded |
| March 30 - April 18 | Episodes 6-8 uploaded |
| April 19 | Season 2 compilation: 57 million views in one month |
| April 25-29 | Episodes 9-11: war narrative escalates |
| April 29 | Season 3 compilation: 108 million views in three weeks |
| End of April | DaFuq!?Boom! enters Top 50 most-viewed US YouTube channels (#33) |

**Key affordance**: YouTube Shorts algorithm promoted short, episodic content with high completion rates

**Narrative development**: The series evolved from single-joke format to serialized war narrative (Skibidi Toilets vs. Cameramen), creating return viewership

### 1.3 Explosion Phase (May - July 2023)

**Inflection point**: Early May to June 2023

**Platform expansion**: 
- YouTube (primary) → TikTok (secondary)
- By end of June 2023: 15.8 million YouTube subscribers, 2.8 million TikTok followers

**View accumulation**:
- By June 2023: 5 billion total views (most-viewed US YouTube channel that month)
- By November 2023: 65 billion views across platforms

**Fan content emergence**: 
- May 6, 2023: First major fan video (28 million views in two weeks)
- Fan analysis videos, theory content, lore documentation began

**Cross-platform recognition**:
- July 9, 2023: Viral Twitter post calling it "Gen Alpha's Slenderman" (31,000 likes)
- Mainstream media coverage began

### 1.4 Behavioral Uptake Phase (June - August 2023)

**"Skibidi Toilet Syndrome" emergence**:

| Date | Event | Platform | Location |
|------|-------|----------|----------|
| June 29, 2023 | First viral video of child imitating Skibidi | TikTok | Indonesia |
| July 2023 | Term "Sindrom Skibidi Toilet" coined | Indonesian web | Indonesia |
| July 12-14 | Warning videos about "syndrome" | YouTube/TikTok | Indonesia |
| July 22-26 | Indonesian YouTubers react to syndrome memes | YouTube | Indonesia |
| August 2023 | Memes spread to English-speaking platforms | TikTok/Reddit | Global |
| August 4, 2023 | Malaysian kindergarten teacher reports classroom impact | Facebook | Malaysia |

**Offline manifestation documented**:
- Children popping out of containers singing the song
- Imitation of head movements and sounds
- Drawings of characters appearing in schools
- Teachers reporting disruption

**Geographic spread pattern**: Indonesia → Malaysia → Global English-speaking

### 1.5 Modality Analysis

**Primary carrier**: Audio-visual (video + song)

**The song as semantic packet**:
- The "skibidi" vocalization is the extractable unit
- Children reproduce the sound without needing to watch the video
- Audio meme travels separately from visual content

**Visual component**:
- Character designs (Cameramen, Speakermen, TV Men) become drawable/reproducible
- Children's drawings document visual transmission

**Gestural component**:
- Head-popping movement
- Container-emergence behavior
- These require no technology to reproduce

**Platform affordances exploited**:
- YouTube Shorts: Algorithm promotion of short episodic content
- TikTok: Sound reuse functionality
- Roblox: Fan-made games (millions of players per month)
- School hallways: Peer imitation, no platform required

```

### 1.7 Key Findings: Skibidi

1. **Origin platform**: YouTube Shorts, not TikTok
2. **Primary affordance**: Serialized short-form video with narrative hook
3. **Cross-platform jump mechanism**: Sound reuse (TikTok), fan games (Roblox), parent documentation (TikTok again)
4. **Offline uptake**: Gestural and vocal imitation required no technology
5. **Geographic pattern**: Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia) was early amplification zone for behavioral uptake documentation
6. **Time to mass saturation**: ~4-5 months from first upload to "syndrome" discourse

## Case Study 2: The 6/7 Meme

### 2.1 Origin Point

**Creator**: Skrilla (Philadelphia rapper)

**Song**: "Doot Doot (6 7)"

**Release dates**: 
- Unofficial: December 1, 2024
- Official: February 7, 2025

**Lyrical content**: "6-7" appears as a phrase with no fixed meaning
- Possible references: 67th Street (Philadelphia), police code 10-67
- Creator has stated he intentionally left meaning undefined

**Initial context**: Philadelphia drill scene music

### 2.2 Sports Edit Phase (December 2024 - February 2025)

**First viral use**: December 1, 2024 - TikTok video edit of LaMelo Ball (Charlotte Hornets guard, listed height: 6'7")

**Key video**: TikToker @matvii_grinblat posts edit where commentator mentions Ball's height, triggering the song—9.6 million views in two months

**Mechanism**: 
- The number "6-7" coincides with basketball player height
- Sports highlight edits use the song as backing
- The phrase becomes associated with basketball content

### 2.3 Personality Amplification Phase (Early 2025)

**Key figure**: Taylen "TK" Kinney (Overtime Elite basketball player)

**Behavior**: Began inserting "six seven" into interviews and content, paired with distinctive hand gesture (see-saw motion, palms up)

**Viral clip**: Kinney rating a Starbucks drink as "six seven"

**Effect**: The phrase detaches from basketball height and becomes general-purpose interjection

**Nickname earned**: "Mr. 6-7"

### 2.4 The "67 Kid" Phase (March 2025)

**Viral moment**: Maverick Trevillian appears in YouTuber Cam Wilder's basketball video, shouting "six seven" with exaggerated hand gesture

**Effect**: Child becomes face of the meme, dubbed "67 Kid"

**Subsequent development** (August 2025): Grotesque photo edits of Trevillian circulate as "SCP-067 Kid" (analog horror parody)

### 2.5 Mass Saturation Phase (September - October 2025)

**School return timing**: Surge coincides with students returning to school

**Classroom impact**:
- Teachers report constant disruption
- Some schools implement bans
- Reports of students saying it "up to 75 times daily"

**Institutional recognition**:
- Dictionary.com names "67" 2025 Word of the Year
- Merriam-Webster adds entry defining it as "nonsensical expression"
- South Park episode (Season 28, Episode 1, October 2025)
- Google easter egg: searching "67" triggers hand-gesture animation

**Political uptake**:
- Connecticut Representative Bill Buckbee (67th District) uses phrase in legislative session
- Utah Representative Blake Moore references trend while presiding over House
- VP JD Vance jokes about banning the phrase after child yells it in church

### 2.6 Modality Analysis

**Primary carrier**: Audio (song lyric) + Gestural (hand motion)

**The phrase as semantic packet**:
- Two syllables: "six" + "seven"
- No semantic content required
- Infinitely repeatable
- Trigger-based activation (any appearance of numbers 6 and 7)

**The gesture**:
- See-saw hand motion, palms facing up
- Can be performed without sound
- Visible signal of in-group membership

**Trigger mechanism**:
- Any occurrence of 67 (order numbers, scores, times, addresses)
- Becomes compulsive response to environmental stimulus

```

### 2.8 Key Findings: 6/7

1. **Origin platform**: Music release, but TikTok sports edits were the propagation mechanism
2. **Primary affordance**: Sound reuse in edits + coincidental number-height match
3. **Key amplifier**: Sports content creator ecosystem (Overtime Elite)
4. **Offline uptake**: Gestural + vocal, trigger-based activation pattern
5. **Semantic emptiness as feature**: The deliberate meaninglessness is what made it spread
6. **Time to mass saturation**: ~10 months from unofficial release to "Word of the Year" status

## Comparative Analysis

### Channel Comparison

| Dimension | Skibidi Toilet | 6/7 Meme |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Origin platform | YouTube Shorts | Music release → TikTok |
| Primary modality | Audio-visual narrative | Audio-gestural interjection |
| Semantic content | Characters, lore, narrative | None (deliberate emptiness) |
| Offline manifestation | Imitative play (container emergence) | Trigger-response vocalization |
| Geographic amplification | Southeast Asia | United States |
| Time to saturation | ~4-5 months | ~10 months |
| Institutional response | "Syndrome" discourse, parental concern | School bans, dictionary recognition |

### Affordance Exploitation

**Both exploited**:
- Short-form video algorithm promotion
- Sound reuse functionality
- Peer imitation dynamics
- Low barrier to participation

**Skibidi-specific**:
- Serialized narrative creating return viewership
- Character design enabling fan content
- Game platform integration (Roblox)

**6/7-specific**:
- Number coincidence (height, scores, order numbers)
- Trigger-based activation (environmental cues)
- Sports content creator ecosystem

### Flattening Properties Confirmed

Both phenomena demonstrate the properties SPE-016 identifies as flattening:

1. **Repetition without invention**: Participation means repeating the token, not generating new meaning
2. **No accumulation**: The hundredth "skibidi" or "six seven" is identical to the first
3. **Easy capture**: Both have been commercially co-opted (merchandise, official recognition)
4. **Exhaustion**: "Brainrot" discourse emerges around both

## Implications for Intervention Design

### What This Evidence Shows

1. **YouTube Shorts and TikTok are primary channels** for Gen Alpha semantic circulation
2. **Sound reuse is a key propagation mechanism**—the audio can travel separately from original context
3. **Sports/gaming content creator ecosystems are amplification nodes**
4. **Offline uptake happens through gestural and vocal imitation**—no technology required once pattern is learned
5. **Trigger-based patterns spread faster** than narrative-dependent patterns
6. **~4-10 months** from origin to mass saturation is typical timeline
7. **Southeast Asia and sports communities** have been significant amplification zones

### What This Means for LSA Design

A platform-native LSA must:

1. **Fit the YouTube Shorts / TikTok format** (these are the actual channels)
2. **Have an extractable audio component** that can travel via sound reuse
3. **Have a gestural component** that enables offline propagation
4. **NOT be purely trigger-based** (that's flattening)—must require invention
5. **Account for sports/gaming amplification nodes** as potential seeding points
6. **Anticipate ~6-month timeline** for initial propagation testing

### Gaps in This Research

This appendix does not yet provide:

1. **Quantitative platform-specific metrics** (exact view counts by platform over time)
2. **Demographic breakdowns** (age, location, platform-specific audiences)
3. **Network analysis** (who shared to whom, influence mapping)
4. **Algorithmic factors** (what specific algorithm features promoted these)
5. **Offline ethnography** (systematic classroom observation, playground research)

These gaps should be addressed in subsequent research.

## Conclusion

The theoretical framework of SPE-016 is now grounded in observable circulation patterns. The channels are identifiable: YouTube Shorts, TikTok, sports content ecosystems, school hallways. The modalities are specified: audio-visual, gestural, trigger-based. The timelines are documented: 4-10 months to mass saturation.

This evidence confirms that:

1. The flattening channel IS the industrial channel where intervention must occur
2. Retreat to artisanal channels would miss the actual circulation pathways
3. Liberatory intervention must fit these affordances while resisting flattening properties

The roads have been mapped. The question now is what to send down them.
