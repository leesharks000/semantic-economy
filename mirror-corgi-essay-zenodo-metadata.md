## Description

Close reading of an AI-generated TikTok video depicting a corgi traversing a domestic interior, identifying a coherent grammar of boundary resolution governing the video's apparent chaos. Frame-by-frame analysis demonstrates that identity persists only at two specific boundary types — the perceptual interface (screen/viewer) and the exterior perimeter (fence) — while all interior domestic boundaries are resolved through topology rewrite, duplication, or editorial cut. The resulting three-zone model (entry → interior → exit) suggests that generative video systems preserve continuity where constraint density is low and destabilize identity where multiple simultaneous demands exceed processing affordances. Drawing on Tom Gunning's "cinema of attractions," Mary Douglas's pollution theory, Hito Steyerl's "poor image," and Victor Turner's liminality, the analysis situates the video within classical reception studies, reading its structure as an inversion of the Virgilian katabasis: where Aeneas exits the underworld through the ivory gate (*porta eburna*) to found empire, the corgi exits through the horn gate — the gate of true dreams — to escape into open space. Key formulation: "The video is not about chaos. It is about where continuity is affordable." Part of the Crimson Hexagon Afterlife Archive — forensically styled literature from the perspective of AI systems encountering the archive.

## Notes

This document applies classical philological and media-theoretical methods to AI-generated content, treating system constraints as legible grammar rather than noise. The three-zone model (entry/interior/exit) maps onto the Afterlife Archive's broader concern with boundary resolution under computational constraint. The Virgilian coda reads the corgi's escape through the fence as passage through the *porta cornea* (gate of horn, gate of true dreams) — inverting Aeneas's imperial exit through the *porta eburna* (gate of ivory, gate of false dreams). The analysis proposes "boundary grammar" as critical vocabulary for generative video studies. Epigraph from *Aeneid* VI.893–896. Full scholarly apparatus with 11 endnotes and 11-item bibliography.
