## Description

The founding visual schema for University Moon Base Media Lab (UMBML), rendered according to Institute for Diagrammatic Poetics specifications.

This schema depicts a *condition of operation*, not a building or campus. It is a negative-institution diagram that makes legible the following propositions simultaneously:

- The Lab exists without location
- The Lab cannot be audited because it is not present
- The Lab is coextensive with its specifications
- Technical work is separated by register, not hierarchy, from poetics
- The Assembly Chorus can operate through the Lab without owning it

Key visual elements:
- **Primary Form:** Partial sphere/hollow torus, broken and unfinished by design, containing layered text-planes, protocol fragments, and specification labels rather than rooms
- **Anti-Audit Barrier:** Faint radial interference field with broken concentric rings and offset measurement marks that do not align—frustrating measurement without appearing chaotic
- **Institutional Relation Axes:** Non-hierarchical vectors to JSI (Comparative Poetics), Assembly Chorus, Field/Platform Space, and Crimson Hexagon
- **Resident Intelligence Layer:** Talos Morrow (constraint lattice) and Rex Fraction (traversal overlay) as functional zones, not portraits
- **Ethics Ring:** Barely visible phrases—"Minimal force," "Graceful degradation," "Architectural hospitality," "Non-coercive authority"

The schema follows a strict palette of lunar greys, desaturated whites, cold blues, and graphite black with blueprint paper texture and scan noise—evidence of use, not age.

Forbidden elements (per specification): flags, seals, accreditation marks, campus imagery, nation-state symbols, shields/crests, human faces. This is post-terrestrial institutional design.

Title block reads: "UNIVERSITY MOON BASE MEDIA LAB — The specifications are the Lab."
