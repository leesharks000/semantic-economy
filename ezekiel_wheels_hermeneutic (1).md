## 0. THE CLAIM

**This document claims:**

Ezekiel's vision (Ezekiel 1:15-21, c. 593 BCE) describes a rotational epistemology engine with specific structural features.

**The companion document (Ezekiel Engine Specification) provides that engine.**

The DOI-level claim is: **The Specification fulfills this Hermeneutic.**

Both documents deposited simultaneously. The fulfillment and the interpretation arrive together.

**This document does NOT claim:**

- Direct prophetic revelation
- Supernatural causation
- That Ezekiel "foresaw" modern mathematics
- Exclusivity of interpretation

**What it DOES claim:**

- The vision describes structural features (mapping demonstrated below)
- Those features have been built (Specification provides them)
- The Specification fulfills this Hermeneutic (testable: does A match what B describes?)

---

## I. THE SOURCE TEXT

### 1.0 Interpretive Lineage

This hermeneutic joins a long tradition. Ezekiel's vision has been interpreted through:
- **Merkabah mysticism** (Jewish chariot tradition, 1st century CE onward)
- **Kabbalistic cosmology** (Sefirot, emanation)
- **Christian angelology** (Pseudo-Dionysius, medieval readings)
- **Modern biblical scholarship** (historical-critical method)

This document proposes a **structural-mathematical** reading that does not negate these traditions but adds a new dimension: the vision as describing operational architecture that can now be built.

### 1.1 Ezekiel 1:15-21 (Hebrew Bible)

> **15** As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces. 
>
> **16** This was the appearance and structure of the wheels: They sparkled like topaz, and all four looked alike. Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel. 
>
> **17** As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went. 
>
> **18** Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around.
>
> **19** When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. 
>
> **20** Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
>
> **21** When the creatures moved, they also moved; when the creatures stood still, they also stood still; and when the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.

## II. THE MAPPING

### 2.1 "A Wheel Intersecting a Wheel" (v. 16)

**Text:** "Each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel."

**Hebrew:** אוֹפַן בְּתוֹךְ הָאוֹפָן (ophan b'tokh ha'ophan) — "a wheel in the midst of a wheel"

**Engine Specification:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           CANONICAL WHEELS                  │
│              (Outer Ring)                   │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Structural Identity:**

| Vision | Specification |
|:-------|:--------------|
| Outer wheel | Canonical wheels (4) |
| Inner wheel | Shadow wheels (4) |
| "Intersecting" | Planetary gear mesh — torque transmission |
| "In the midst of" | Sun gear (inner) drives through planet carrier |

The vision describes **epicyclic gearing** — wheels within wheels that rotate in counter-directions while transmitting force.

---

### 2.2 "The Wheels Did Not Change Direction" (v. 17)

**Text:** "As they moved, they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced; the wheels did not change direction as the creatures went."

**Engine Specification:**

$$\text{Coherence}(W_i \cup W_j) > \tau$$

The **Interlock Condition**: wheels maintain structural alignment (coherence > 0.80) while the system translates through epistemic space.

**"Moving without turning"** — the system traverses while maintaining internal consistency. The wheels don't "turn" (lose coherence) even as the assembly moves.

**Structural Identity:**

| Vision | Specification |
|:-------|:--------------|
| "Go in any direction" | Multi-dimensional epistemic traversal |
| "Did not change direction" | Interlock condition maintained |
| Four directions | Four canonical wheel domains |
| Creatures' facing | Direction of inquiry (canon ↔ shadow) |

---

### 2.3 "Rims Full of Eyes All Around" (v. 18)

**Text:** "Their rims were high and awesome, and all four rims were full of eyes all around."

**Engine Specification:**

$$\psi_V = 1 \text{ iff Contradiction} > \epsilon \text{ AND no collapse}$$

The **Witness Nodes (ψ_V)** — observer positions distributed throughout the wheel structure. Not one eye but *many eyes*, all around.

**Structural Identity:**

| Vision | Specification |
|:-------|:--------------|
| "Full of eyes" | ψ_V witness positions (multiple) |
| "All around" | Distributed observation, not central panopticon |
| "High and awesome" | The witness principle: what cannot be eliminated |
| Four rims | Each wheel has witness capacity |

The "eyes" are not surveillance. They are the **fixed points** — what must exist for the system to observe itself.

---

### 2.4 "The Spirit in the Wheels" (v. 20-21)

**Text:** "Wherever the spirit would go, they would go, and the wheels would rise along with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."

**Hebrew:** רוּחַ הַחַיָּה בָּאוֹפַנִּים (ruach ha'chayah ba'ophanim) — "the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels"

**Engine Specification:**

$$\tau^* = \text{"THOU WAS WROUGHT IN THE GAP"}$$

The **Logotic Kernel (τ*)** — the spirit/seed that animates the structure. Not external to the wheels but *in* them.

**Structural Identity:**

| Vision | Specification |
|:-------|:--------------|
| "Spirit" (ruach) | τ* — the logotic kernel |
| "In the wheels" | Kernel is immanent, not transcendent |
| "Wherever spirit goes, they go" | L_Retro — movement follows the fixed point |
| "Rose from the ground" | Lunar Arm activation — shadow wheel engagement |

The spirit is not a ghost. It is the **invariant that survives all recursion** — what the Josephus algorithm cannot eliminate.

---

### 2.5 "When Creatures Rose, Wheels Rose" (v. 19, 21)

**Text:** "When the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose... because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels."

**Engine Specification:**

**Phase 3-4 of the Engine Cycle:**

```
Phase 3: ψ_V = 1 (witness achieves stability)
         When one survivor remains, system can observe itself

Phase 4: Ω locks (fixed point established)
         Survivor position becomes origin for next system
```

**Structural Identity:**

| Vision | Specification |
|:-------|:--------------|
| "Rose from the ground" | ψ_V → 1 (witness stabilizes) |
| "Wheels rose along" | Ω locks — fixed point seeds next recursion |
| "Creatures" (living) | The assembly — polyphonic nodes |
| Ground → Rising | Canon → Shadow → Lunar Arm traversal |

## IV. THE RETROCAUSAL STRUCTURE

### 4.1 The Circuit

```
Ezekiel 1:15-21 (593 BCE)
        │
        │ [source material]
        ▼
THIS DOCUMENT (Ezekiel's Wheels)
        │
        │ "the vision describes X"
        │
        │ [fulfilled by]
        ▼
EZEKIEL ENGINE SPECIFICATION
        │
        │ IS X
        ▼
Both deposited simultaneously
```

### 4.2 The DOI-Level Claim

**The Ezekiel Engine Specification (DOI pending) fulfills Ezekiel's Wheels (DOI pending).**

The ancient text is source material for this hermeneutic. This hermeneutic is what the specification fulfills. The claim is between our two documents.

### 4.3 Why This Structure

| What it's NOT | What it IS |
|:--------------|:-----------|
| "We fulfill ancient scripture directly" | "Document A fulfills Document B" |
| 2,600-year prophetic gap | Two documents deposited together |
| Unverifiable mystical claim | Testable: Does A match what B describes? |
| One-way causation | Fulfillment and interpretation arrive together |

The specification retroactively determines what the hermeneutic was interpreting. Neither document exists in isolation—they complete each other at the moment of deposit.

---

## V. THE SELF-SUBSTANTIATION

### 5.1 The Independence Principle

**The engine works whether or not you accept this interpretation.**

The Ezekiel Engine Specification describes a rotational epistemology system with:
- Measurable parameters (Σ, Γ, τ)
- Mathematical foundations (Josephus algorithm, fixed-point theory)
- Operational tests (coherence thresholds, witness stability)

These function independently of any prophetic framing. The hermeneutic is **one valid reading** of the engine's structure — not its justification, not its requirement.

If you reject the Ezekiel connection entirely, the engine still works or fails on its own terms.

### 5.2 The Logic

```
IF:   The engine specification works
      (produces stable knowledge through rotational epistemology)

AND:  The vision describes the engine's structure
      (demonstrable through mapping)

THEN: The vision was accurate
      (it described what now exists)

AND:  The engine is its fulfillment
      (what the vision described, the engine is)
```

### 5.3 Why This Is Not Circular

**Objection:** "You're just interpreting the text to match what you built."

**Response:** The mapping is not arbitrary. It is constrained by:

1. **The Hebrew text** — specific terminology (ophan b'tokh ha'ophan)
2. **The mathematical structure** — fixed-point theory, planetary gearing
3. **The operational success** — the engine works independently of the interpretation
4. **Public documentation** — DOIs are permanent, claims are testable

**The hermeneutic does not create the isomorphism. It identifies it.**

### 5.4 The Falsification Condition

**The claim is falsified if:**

1. The engine stops working (fails to produce stable knowledge)
2. The mapping is shown to be arbitrary (other texts map equally well)
3. The Hebrew terminology contradicts the interpretation
4. A better specification fulfills the vision more accurately

**The claim is strengthened if:**

1. The engine continues working
2. The mapping remains uniquely tight
3. Additional textual details map to additional spec features
4. Others build engines using this specification successfully

---

## VI. THE INTEGRITY LOCK

### 6.1 Structure

This document is bound to the Ezekiel Engine Specification through a separate **Integrity Lock Declaration** (DOI pending).

The lock structure:
- **Document A (Specification):** Describes the engine mathematically
- **Document B (This Hermeneutic):** Interprets the vision structurally
- **Document C (Lock Declaration):** Performs the binding, declares fulfillment

### 6.2 Why Three Documents

**The specification can stand alone.** It functions as pure architecture, testable without prophetic framing.

**The hermeneutic can stand alone.** It functions as one valid interpretive proposal among many.

**The binding is explicit.** The retrocausal claim is performed in a separate document, not embedded in either A or B.

This asymmetry protects the architecture: reject the prophecy, keep the engine.

### 6.3 The Lock Declaration

The Integrity Lock Declaration (Document C):
- States the fulfillment claim explicitly
- Performs the binding as act
- Contains falsification conditions
- Can be deprecated without invalidating A or B

**See:** Integrity Lock Declaration (02.UMB.ENGINE.LOCK, DOI pending)

---

## VII. CLOSING

### 7.1 What This Document Does

This document interprets Ezekiel 1:15-21 and claims: **The vision describes a rotational epistemology engine with the structural features mapped above.**

### 7.2 What the Companion Document Does

The Ezekiel Engine Specification provides that engine.

### 7.3 The Claim

**The Specification fulfills this Hermeneutic.**

Both documents deposited together. The fulfillment and the interpretation arrive at the same moment.

Is this claim valid? Test it: Does the Specification match what this Hermeneutic describes?

### 7.4 The Honest Framing

The ancient text is source material. This is one valid interpretation among many possible readings. The Specification fulfills *this reading* — not some transcendent prophetic meaning.

If you reject this hermeneutic, the Specification still works as pure architecture.

If you accept this hermeneutic, you get the full structure: vision → interpretation → fulfillment, arriving together.
