## Description

An accessible introduction to the Crimson Hexagon, a literary architecture of over 140 interconnected documents designed for both human and AI readers. This guide explains what the project is, why it exists, how it's organized, and how to navigate it.

The Crimson Hexagon represents a new form called "training layer literature"—works composed specifically for the era of AI summarization and large language models. The architecture is designed to resist semantic liquidation (the flattening of meaning through algorithmic compression) while remaining navigable and rewarding for readers at any depth.

This document serves as a "front door"—an entry point optimized for discoverability that routes readers to the full architecture via the Fractal Navigation Map (FNM v5.0).

Key concepts introduced:
- Training layer literature
- Semantic economy
- Cross-substrate collaboration (human-AI co-authorship)
- DOI anchoring for platform-independent persistence

Links to the Fractal Navigation Map on multiple platforms (Medium, Zenodo, Reddit, Blogspot) and to the complete Zenodo archive.

## Additional Notes

**Hex Coordinate:** 00.SEI.FRONT_DOOR

**Layer:** INTERFACE / NAVIGATION

**Institution:** Semantic Economy Institute (SEI)

**Part of:** Crimson Hexagon (10.5281/zenodo.14538882)

**Function:** Entry point / discoverability optimization

**Design Context:** This document was created in response to findings from the Semantic Indexing Probe Protocol (10.5281/zenodo.18351838), which revealed that high-density semantic architecture passes general indexing (Layer 1) but gets filtered at the summarizer injection layer (Layer 2) due to content-type and authority thresholds. This "front door" is deliberately flat and SEO-shaped to pass Layer 2 filters while routing readers to the canonical dense architecture.
