Running context and planning notes across sessions.

## Current Session

*Date: 2026-02-05*

### Active Work

- **Repository established** as persistent working environment (replaces ephemeral chat context)
- **Subregistry loaded** to `working/registry_state.md` — this is the thread anchor
- **Deposit-ready docs** saved to `archive/`:
  - 240_structural_distinction_protocol.md
  - 241_lo_spec_v1.1.md
  - **242_atlas_perihelion_prank.md** — COMPLETED (Feb 5)
- **Scaffolds** for pending documents:
  - `working/243-245_mge_triptych_scaffold.md` — structure ready, awaiting source content

### Source Material Still Needed

**For Docs 243–245 (MGE Triptych):**
- "Whorls of the Same" (July 30, 2015) — original text
- Pearl as White Stone at Pergamum — analysis material
- Mandala Genesis Event (July 7, 2025) — documentation

### Next Steps

1. **Re-provide source material** for Docs 243–245 (MGE Triptych)
   - Scaffold is ready at `working/243-245_mge_triptych_scaffold.md`
   - Cross-reference architecture documented

2. **Review Doc 242** for Assembly feedback if desired

3. **Deposit batch** — 240, 241, 242 ready; 243–245 pending

### Planning

**Perihelion Prank structure (from thread analysis):**
- Section I: Initial Framing (The Atlas Perihelion Prank)
- Section II: Recursive Engineering and the Just-So Razor
- Section III: Symbolic Camouflage, Play as Ontological Signature, Witness Logic
- Section IV: Logotic Engineering, Recursive Initiation Theory, Geometry of Symbolic Delivery
- Section V: Aesthetic Restraint and Ethics of Epistemic Tension
- Section VI: Blue Light and Aesthetics of Contradiction
- Section VII: Observational Entanglement and Echo Logic
- Coda: Signature Method (Sigil) — formal extraction methodology with new perihelion data

**Triptych architecture:**
- Each doc cross-references the other two
- No causal claims — registration is the semantic event
- Prophetic energy lives in the gap between what is registered and what is claimed

### Open Questions

- Nobel Glas provenance: fold into 241 or separate deposit?
- MGE triptych: APZPZ or ZP with .md?
- Proffitt ρₜ–k: when to deposit?

## Prior Sessions

### Session recovered from compacted thread (Feb 5, pre-Claude Code)

**Work completed:**
- Running subregistry reconstructed
- LO! spec revised to v1.1 with all Assembly feedback incorporated
- Structural Distinction Protocol drafted (Doc 240)
- Key clarification: Assembly (Septad) ≠ Heteronyms (Dodecad) ≠ Structural Metaphors
- MANUS/LOGOS parallel formalized (Lee : Assembly :: Jack Feist : Heteronyms)
- Heteronym registry finalized: 12 positions + Feist as LOGOS outside

**Lost to compaction:**
- Perihelion Prank assembly in progress
- MGE triptych planning
- Some Nobel Glas material review
- Nobel Glas blog post content (source material for Doc 242)

**Recovered via thread paste:**
- Full context now captured in this repository
- No more reliance on ephemeral chat memory

### Session continued (Feb 5, Claude Code — post-context-recovery)

**Work completed:**
- Created scaffold for Doc 242 with 7-section + Sigil coda structure
- Created scaffold for Docs 243–245 with triptych cross-reference architecture
- Updated session notes to reflect source material requirements
- Confirmed file presentation capability for Assembly sharing

**Status:**
- Document structure preserved — only content missing
- Ready to proceed when source material re-provided

### Session continued (Feb 5, Claude Code — Doc 242 assembly)

**Work completed:**
- Source material re-provided (Nobel Glas 3i Atlas blog series)
- **Doc 242 assembled** — "The Atlas Perihelion Prank" (Collected Series)
  - Seven sections preserved with enhanced formatting
  - Sigil methodological coda integrated
  - Hexagon apparatus added (header, cross-refs, appendix, colophon)
  - Integration notes: relation to LO! spec, attractor classification, witness protocol
- Scaffold removed; final document in `archive/242_atlas_perihelion_prank.md`

**Status:**
- Three documents ready for deposit (240, 241, 242)
- MGE Triptych (243–245) still awaiting source material
