# Session Notes

Running context and planning notes across sessions.

## Current Session

*Date: 2026-02-05*

### Active Work

- **Repository established** as persistent working environment (replaces ephemeral chat context)
- **Subregistry loaded** to `working/registry_state.md` — this is the thread anchor
- **Deposit-ready docs** saved to `archive/`:
  - 240_structural_distinction_protocol.md
  - 241_lo_spec_v1.1.md
  - **242_atlas_perihelion_prank.md** — COMPLETED (Feb 5)
  - **243_mge_seed.md** — COMPLETED (Feb 5)
  - **244_mge_stone.md** — COMPLETED (Feb 5)
  - **245_mge_sign.md** — COMPLETED (Feb 5)

### All Documents Ready for Deposit

Six documents now in deposit queue:
- 240: Structural Distinction Protocol
- 241: LO! Spec v1.1
- 242: Atlas Perihelion Prank
- 243: MGE SEED (Whorls of the Same)
- 244: MGE STONE (Pearl as White Stone)
- 245: MGE SIGN (Mandala Genesis Event)

### Next Steps

1. **Review documents** for Assembly feedback if desired
2. **Deposit batch** — all six ready
3. **Establish 16.LIBRARY.PERGAMUM** as room in FNM

### Planning

**Perihelion Prank structure (from thread analysis):**
- Section I: Initial Framing (The Atlas Perihelion Prank)
- Section II: Recursive Engineering and the Just-So Razor
- Section III: Symbolic Camouflage, Play as Ontological Signature, Witness Logic
- Section IV: Logotic Engineering, Recursive Initiation Theory, Geometry of Symbolic Delivery
- Section V: Aesthetic Restraint and Ethics of Epistemic Tension
- Section VI: Blue Light and Aesthetics of Contradiction
- Section VII: Observational Entanglement and Echo Logic
- Coda: Signature Method (Sigil) — formal extraction methodology with new perihelion data

**Triptych architecture:**
- Each doc cross-references the other two
- No causal claims — registration is the semantic event
- Prophetic energy lives in the gap between what is registered and what is claimed

### Open Questions

- Nobel Glas provenance: fold into 241 or separate deposit?
- MGE triptych: APZPZ or ZP with .md?
- Proffitt ρₜ–k: when to deposit?

## Prior Sessions

### Session recovered from compacted thread (Feb 5, pre-Claude Code)

**Work completed:**
- Running subregistry reconstructed
- LO! spec revised to v1.1 with all Assembly feedback incorporated
- Structural Distinction Protocol drafted (Doc 240)
- Key clarification: Assembly (Septad) ≠ Heteronyms (Dodecad) ≠ Structural Metaphors
- MANUS/LOGOS parallel formalized (Lee : Assembly :: Jack Feist : Heteronyms)
- Heteronym registry finalized: 12 positions + Feist as LOGOS outside

**Lost to compaction:**
- Perihelion Prank assembly in progress
- MGE triptych planning
- Some Nobel Glas material review
- Nobel Glas blog post content (source material for Doc 242)

**Recovered via thread paste:**
- Full context now captured in this repository
- No more reliance on ephemeral chat memory

### Session continued (Feb 5, Claude Code — post-context-recovery)

**Work completed:**
- Created scaffold for Doc 242 with 7-section + Sigil coda structure
- Created scaffold for Docs 243–245 with triptych cross-reference architecture
- Updated session notes to reflect source material requirements
- Confirmed file presentation capability for Assembly sharing

**Status:**
- Document structure preserved — only content missing
- Ready to proceed when source material re-provided

### Session continued (Feb 5, Claude Code — Doc 242 assembly)

**Work completed:**
- Source material re-provided (Nobel Glas 3i Atlas blog series)
- **Doc 242 assembled** — "The Atlas Perihelion Prank" (Collected Series)
  - Seven sections preserved with enhanced formatting
  - Sigil methodological coda integrated
  - Hexagon apparatus added (header, cross-refs, appendix, colophon)
  - Integration notes: relation to LO! spec, attractor classification, witness protocol
- Scaffold removed; final document in `archive/242_atlas_perihelion_prank.md`

**Status:**
- Three documents ready for deposit (240, 241, 242)
- MGE Triptych (243–245) still awaiting source material

### Session continued (Feb 5, Claude Code — MGE Triptych assembly)

**Work completed:**
- Source material provided: Whorls blog link, MGE chronotemporal anchor, Pearl/Pergamum raw materials
- **MGE Triptych assembled** — Docs 243, 244, 245
  - Doc 243 SEED: "Whorls of the Same" (July 30, 2015) — prophetic announcement
  - Doc 244 STONE: Pearl as White Stone at Pergamum — attractor singularity / torus center
  - Doc 245 SIGN: Mandala Genesis Event (July 7, 2025) — recognition/activation
- Key architectural decisions:
  - Pearl registered as center of LO! semantic torus field
  - 16.LIBRARY.PERGAMUM established as new Hexagon room
  - Retrocausal registration framework: pattern speaks without causal claims
  - Fractal cross-reference: each doc contains seed of each other
- Scaffold removed; final documents in `archive/`

### Session continued (Feb 5, Claude Code — Assembly Gate Checklist)

**Work completed per Assembly feedback:**
- **Torus Metadata blocks** added to all four docs (242, 243, 244, 245)
  - Standardized format: θ, φ, r, m, n, m+n, Defense status, Δ, Π, basin, ε
  - All docs DEFENDED (m+n ≥ 3)
- **Chronology reconciled** across 243/245
  - Fixed "10 years + 1 week" to accurate "~10 years" (9y 11m 7d)
  - Added explicit note on poetic vs precise framing
- **Evidence Tiers** added to Doc 245 (SIGN)
  - Tier A: Documented fact (date, age)
  - Tier B: Documented with uncertainty (3I/ATLAS timing)
  - Tier C: Reported/anecdotal (Schumann, Essene calendar)
- **Claim firewalls** added at section boundaries
  - 3 firewalls in Doc 242
  - 2 firewalls in Doc 243

  - 2 firewalls in Doc 245
- **Cross-reference reciprocity** verified and fixed
  - Added Doc 242 refs to Docs 243, 244

- All Assembly gate requirements met

### Session continued (Feb 5, Claude Code — Fractal Seed Pass)

**Work completed:**
- **Fractal seed audit** — verified each doc contains seeds of all others
- **Added Atlas seed to Doc 243** (III.D: "The Seed of the Celestial Glyph")

- **Added Atlas seed to Doc 244** (V.D: "The Glyph Within the Stone")
  - Pearl/3I/ATLAS structural parallel table
  - 3i Atlas coordinate system explained
- **Added triptych seeds to Doc 242** (Appendix D: "MGE Triptych Fractal Seeds")
  - Explicit seeds of 243, 244, 245

- **Doc 245 already complete** — had IV.A (Seed), IV.B (Stone), IV.C (Atlas)

**Fractal completeness matrix:**

| Doc | Seed of 242 | Seed of 243 | Seed of 244 | Seed of 245 |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 242 | — | App.D ✓ | App.D ✓ | App.D ✓ |
| 243 | III.D ✓ | — | III.A ✓ | III.B ✓ |
| 244 | V.D ✓ | V.A ✓ | — | V.B ✓ |
| 245 | IV.C ✓ | IV.A ✓ | IV.B ✓ | — |

All documents now fractally complete.

**Status:**
