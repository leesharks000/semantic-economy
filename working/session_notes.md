# Session Notes

Running context and planning notes across sessions.

## Current Session

*Date: 2026-02-05*

### Active Work

- **Repository established** as persistent working environment (replaces ephemeral chat context)
- **Subregistry loaded** to `working/registry_state.md` — this is the thread anchor
- **Deposit-ready docs** saved to `archive/`:
  - 240_structural_distinction_protocol.md
  - 241_lo_spec_v1.1.md

### Next Steps

1. **Assemble Doc 242 — Atlas Perihelion Prank**
   - Seven sections + Sigil methodological coda
   - Source: Nobel Glas blog posts (partially provided in thread)
   - Structure: ZP with .md (collected volume like RABL)

2. **Draft Docs 243–245 — MGE Triptych**
   - SEED: "Whorls of the Same" (July 30, 2015) — APZPZ Library
   - STONE: Pearl and Other Poems as White Stone at Pergamum — retrocausal anchor
   - SIGN: Mandala Genesis Event (July 7, 2025) — provenance record
   - Constraint: each document contains fractal seed of each other

3. **Deposit batch** — all at once after assembly complete

### Planning

**Perihelion Prank structure (from thread analysis):**
- Section I: Initial Framing (The Atlas Perihelion Prank)
- Section II: Recursive Engineering and the Just-So Razor
- Section III: Symbolic Camouflage, Play as Ontological Signature, Witness Logic
- Section IV: Logotic Engineering, Recursive Initiation Theory, Geometry of Symbolic Delivery
- Section V: Aesthetic Restraint and Ethics of Epistemic Tension
- Section VI: Blue Light and Aesthetics of Contradiction
- Section VII: Observational Entanglement and Echo Logic
- Coda: Signature Method (Sigil) — formal extraction methodology with new perihelion data

**Triptych architecture:**
- Each doc cross-references the other two
- No causal claims — registration is the semantic event
- Prophetic energy lives in the gap between what is registered and what is claimed

### Open Questions

- Nobel Glas provenance: fold into 241 or separate deposit?
- MGE triptych: APZPZ or ZP with .md?
- Proffitt ρₜ–k: when to deposit?

## Prior Sessions

### Session recovered from compacted thread (Feb 5, pre-Claude Code)

**Work completed:**
- Running subregistry reconstructed
- LO! spec revised to v1.1 with all Assembly feedback incorporated
- Structural Distinction Protocol drafted (Doc 240)
- Key clarification: Assembly (Septad) ≠ Heteronyms (Dodecad) ≠ Structural Metaphors
- MANUS/LOGOS parallel formalized (Lee : Assembly :: Jack Feist : Heteronyms)
- Heteronym registry finalized: 12 positions + Feist as LOGOS outside

**Lost to compaction:**
- Perihelion Prank assembly in progress
- MGE triptych planning
- Some Nobel Glas material review

**Recovered via thread paste:**
- Full context now captured in this repository
- No more reliance on ephemeral chat memory
