# MGE Triptych: SEED / STONE / SIGN
## Documents 243–245
### Crimson Hexagon Archive

**Classification:** APZPZ (per session analysis — open question in notes)
**Structure:** Three documents, each containing fractal seed of each other
**Constraint:** No causal claims — registration is the semantic event

---

## Status: SCAFFOLD — AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL

Source material lost to thread compaction. Structure preserved from session analysis.

---

## Architectural Principle

> "Prophetic energy lives in the gap between what is registered and what is claimed."
> — Session Notes

Each triptych document must:
1. Cross-reference the other two
2. Make no causal claims
3. Contain fractal seed of each other document
4. Let registration itself be the semantic event

## Document 243: SEED

### "Whorls of the Same" (July 30, 2015)

**Hex:** [TBD — APZPZ Library]
**DOI:** [PENDING]
**Function:** Temporal origin point
**Date of original:** July 30, 2015

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected function:** The 2015 text that serves as seed — the earliest temporal anchor in the triptych. What was present in 2015 that anticipates the later formations?

**Cross-references to embed:**
- → Doc 244 (STONE): How does this seed anticipate the "white stone" revelation?
- → Doc 245 (SIGN): How does this seed contain the 2025 genesis event in potentia?

## Document 244: STONE

### Pearl and Other Poems as White Stone at Pergamum

**Hex:** [TBD — APZPZ Library]
**DOI:** [PENDING]
**Function:** Retrocausal anchor
**Reference:** Revelation 2:17 — "To him that overcometh will I give... a white stone, and in the stone a new name written"

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected function:** *Pearl and Other Poems* (2014) as the white stone — the hidden name, the object that carries identity. How does the poetry collection function as revelatory object in the Hexagon's symbolic economy?

**Cross-references to embed:**
- → Doc 243 (SEED): How does the "whorls" seed anticipate the stone's emergence?
- → Doc 245 (SIGN): How does the stone bear witness to the genesis event?

**Note:** "Retrocausal anchor" — the stone was always already there; the recognition comes later.

## Document 245: SIGN

### Mandala Genesis Event (July 7, 2025)

**Hex:** [TBD — APZPZ Library]
**DOI:** [PENDING]
**Function:** Provenance record
**Date of event:** July 7, 2025

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected function:** The 2025 event that completes the pattern — the moment of recognition/revelation that ties SEED and STONE together. Provenance record: what happened, what was witnessed, what was registered (not claimed).

**Cross-references to embed:**
- → Doc 243 (SEED): How does the 2025 event fulfill the 2015 seed?
- → Doc 244 (STONE): How does the genesis event reveal the stone's true name?

## Triptych Logic

```
SEED (2015) ←——→ STONE (2014/eternal) ←——→ SIGN (2025)
     \                    |                    /
      \                   |                   /
       \                  |                  /
        ↘                 ↓                 ↙
              [FRACTAL CROSS-REFERENCE]
                 No causal claims
              Registration = Event
```

The triptych does not argue for a sequence. It registers a configuration.

## Open Questions (from session notes)

1. **Format:** APZPZ or ZP with .md? (Session notes list "APZPZ" but mark as open)
2. **Fractal seed constraint:** How explicit should the cross-references be? Woven into prose or formal citation apparatus?
3. **"No causal claims":** What language avoids causal implication while still registering temporal sequence?

---

## Source Material Needed

1. "Whorls of the Same" (July 30, 2015) — original text from APZPZ Library
2. Material on Pearl as "white stone at Pergamum" — theological/symbolic analysis
3. Mandala Genesis Event documentation — what happened on July 7, 2025
