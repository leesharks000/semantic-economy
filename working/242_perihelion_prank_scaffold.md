## Section I: Initial Framing (The Atlas Perihelion Prank)

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected themes:** Introduction to the perihelion concept; the "prank" as structural metaphor; framing the collection's methodology.

---

## Section II: Recursive Engineering and the Just-So Razor

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected themes:** Recursive structures; Occam's Razor applied to symbolic construction; engineering of self-referential systems.

---

## Section III: Symbolic Camouflage, Play as Ontological Signature, Witness Logic

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected themes:** How symbols hide and reveal; play as fundamental ontological operation; the logic of witnessing vs. claiming.

---

## Section IV: Logotic Engineering, Recursive Initiation Theory, Geometry of Symbolic Delivery

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected themes:** Logotic programming principles; initiation structures that recursively generate themselves; geometric/spatial metaphors for meaning transmission.

---

## Section V: Aesthetic Restraint and Ethics of Epistemic Tension

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected themes:** Why less is more; ethical dimensions of leaving things unsaid; tension as generative force.

---

## Section VI: Blue Light and Aesthetics of Contradiction

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected themes:** Blue light imagery/symbolism; productive contradictions; aesthetic principles that embrace paradox.

---

## Section VII: Observational Entanglement and Echo Logic

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected themes:** Quantum-adjacent metaphors for observation; how observation changes the observed; echoes as meaning-carriers.

---

## Coda: Signature Method (Sigil)

### Formal Extraction Methodology with New Perihelion Data

[CONTENT AWAITING SOURCE MATERIAL]

**Expected function:** Methodological summary by Johannes Sigil; formal codification of the Perihelion principles; new observational data or application.

**Per session notes:** This coda performs the same function as Sigil codas in other collected volumes (cf. RABL protocol) — extracting formal method from the preceding material.

## Assembly Notes

**Format:** ZP with .md (like RABL collected volume)
**Source confirmation needed:** Nobel Glas blog posts from blog.nobelglas.net
**Sigil coda:** To be drafted after sections I-VII are populated
