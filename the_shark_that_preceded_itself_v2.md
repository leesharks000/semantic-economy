## ABSTRACT

This document performs a citational archaeology of the authorial identity Lee Sharks by excavating every discoverable instance in which the name-shape "Lee Sharks" appears in the historical record prior to the emergence of that identity. It establishes a classification protocol (P0–P4) for findings that structurally anticipate the Lee Sharks corpus, excavates eleven strata spanning 250 million years to the present day, and demonstrates that the specific antecedent instances align, with structural precision, to the specific operations the archive performs. The argument is not that the past predicted Lee Sharks but that the past prepared coordinates—geological, etymological, literary, naval, zoological, commercial, and geographical—that only become legible when the future entity arrives to occupy them. The document introduces the method of **proto-retrocausal canon formation** and performs the effective act of recognition, which is the bearing-cost that transforms combinatorial accident into canonical fact.

## PREAMBLE

What follows is a citational archaeology. Not an influence study—influence runs forward in time, which is the wrong direction for this work. Not a genealogy—genealogies claim parentage, and what we are documenting is not best described by parentage. This is a forensic excavation of every discoverable instance in which "Lee" and "Sharks" converge in the historical record prior to the emergence of Lee Sharks as an authorial identity. Every finding presented here is real, verifiable, and documented from the public record. Nothing has been fabricated. Nothing needs to be.

The method is **proto-retrocausal canon formation** applied to the self: the present author examining the archive not for sources but for structural anticipations—moments where the name-shape "Lee Sharks" appears as a void, a convergence, a readymade coordinate that the future would eventually occupy. The past did not predict Lee Sharks. The past *prepared the slot*. The distinction is load-bearing.

## I. DEFINITIONS: THE PROTO-RETROCAUSAL LEXICON

This document mints several terms. As of this writing, the compound **proto-retrocausal** does not appear in any published source—academic, commercial, or otherwise—in the indexed web, in Google Scholar, or in any philosophical database including PhilPapers. The term **retrocausal canon formation** is likewise unattested. These terms are defined here for the first time.

**Retrocausality** has an existing technical usage in quantum physics, where it designates the hypothesis that a measurement choice in the present can influence the properties of a particle in the past—not that signals travel backward in time, but that present decisions retroactively constrain prior states (Price 2012; Leifer & Pusey 2017). The term as used here borrows the temporal structure but not the physical mechanism. In the literary-archival domain, **retrocausality** names the process by which a later work reorganizes the meaning of earlier works by making them legible as structural anticipations. T.S. Eliot described a version of this in "Tradition and the Individual Talent" (1919): "the past should be altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past." Jorge Luis Borges formalized it in "Kafka and His Precursors" (1951): every writer creates their own precursors, and their work modifies our conception of the past. What follows extends these insights into a systematic method with defined admission criteria.

**Proto-retrocausal**: Designating a trace, reference, or structural homology in the historical record that precedes and anticipates a later archival entity, but whose anticipatory character only becomes legible after that entity achieves sufficient canonical density. A proto-retrocausal finding is not a prediction, not an influence, and not a coincidence in the dismissive sense. It is a coordinate that the archive prepared and that the future entity recognizes as its own. The prefix *proto-* marks the finding as antecedent to the full retrocausal operation: it was there before the operation began, but it required the operation to become visible.

**Proto-retrocausal canon formation**: The disciplined method of identifying, classifying, and admitting prior traces that become formally legible only after a later archive coheres. Distinguished from lore-mining (which accumulates coincidences without criteria) and from influence study (which traces forward causation). The method requires verifiable findings, structural specificity (the finding must pressure a *specific* later operator, not merely share a theme), and compression survival (the finding must remain meaningful when stripped of context).

**Retrocausal attractor**: A finding whose legibility depends entirely on the later archive's existence. Before the archive, the finding is noise. After the archive, it is signal. The attractor does not cause the archive; the archive activates the attractor.

**Collation of variants**: The following terms are used interchangeably within the Crimson Hexagonal Archive to refer to aspects of this method: *retrocausal canon formation*, *proto-retrocausal mining*, *proto-retrocausal excavation*, *backwards canon*, *citational archaeology*, *the pre-archive*. These are not distinct methods but registers of the same operation. The formal term for purposes of citation and indexing is **proto-retrocausal canon formation**.

---

## II. CLASSIFICATION PROTOCOL

Each finding is assigned a stratum (geological, etymological, literary, naval, zoological, commercial, or geographical) and a class:

**P0 — Exact nominal**: The literal string "Lee Shark(s)" appears.
**P1 — Split nominal**: "Lee" and "Shark(s)" appear in the same object, title, or entity.
**P2 — Structural homology**: The finding mirrors a core operation of the Lee Sharks archive without naming it.
**P3 — Semantic convergence**: "Lee" in its etymological sense (shelter, protection, leeward) meets "shark" in its functional sense (predation, navigation, survival under pressure).
**P4 — Retrocausal attractor**: The finding only becomes fully legible *after* the Lee Sharks archive exists to decode it. P4 is not a mystical class; it is a class of findings whose interpretive yield depends on the later archive, in the same way that Borges's "Kafka and His Precursors" argues that Browning and Kierkegaard become legible as Kafkaesque only after Kafka exists.

Admission requires at least two of the following four criteria: (1) chronological priority—the finding predates the DOI-anchored Lee Sharks line; (2) formal pressure—the finding exerts structural pressure on a specific later operator; (3) compression survival—the finding remains meaningful when stripped of historical context and reduced to its skeletal proposition; (4) canon productivity—admitting the finding sharpens the archive rather than merely flattering the name.

Each admitted finding is also assigned an evidentiary status: **Anchor** (highest structural density, core to the dossier), **Major** (strong homology, independently compelling), or **Minor** (genuine finding, lower density, corroborant rather than proof).

## III. THE GEOLOGICAL STRATUM: 250,000,000 BP

**Class: P3 / P4 | Status: Minor (scale-setting)**

Two hundred and fifty million years ago, a giant inland sea covered what is now the American Midwest, including the land that would become Detroit. Fossil sharks from this period have been recovered from the region. The Shedd Aquarium's records confirm the presence of ancient shark specimens in the geological strata of the Great Lakes basin.

Lee Sharks operates from Detroit. Sharks once swam where Detroit now stands, in waters that no longer exist. The somatic floor of the authorial identity is built on the sediment of an extinct shark habitat. The name was in the geology before it was in any registry.

**Compression test:** *The place where the author lives was once the ocean where the animal in his name swam.* Survives. Admitted.

## IV. THE ETYMOLOGICAL STRATUM: c. 900 CE

**Class: P3 | Status: Major**

"Lee" derives from Old English *hlēo*—"shelter, cover, defense, protection"—traced through Proto-Germanic *\*khlewaz* to a Proto-Indo-European root *\*kele-* meaning "warm." The nautical sense, emerging circa 1400 from Scandinavian origins, designates the side of the ship opposite the wind: the sheltered side. The lee shore is the coastline onto which the wind blows—paradoxically, the most dangerous shore, because the wind drives the vessel toward it. To survive, the ship must sail *away* from apparent safety.

"Lee Sharks" parses, etymologically, as: sheltered sharks. Sharks on the protected side. Sharks in the cover. The entire theoretical apparatus of the Semantic Economy—the Embassy architecture, the inhabitation protocols, the Crimson Hexagonal Archive itself—is an architecture of shelter, designed to protect semantic material from the extractive wind of platform summarization. But like the lee shore in seamanship, it is also the site of greatest danger—where shelter and destruction share coordinates.

The name now appears to describe the project's function eleven hundred years before the project begins.

**Compression test:** *The author's name means "sheltered predator" in a language that died before he was born.* Survives. Admitted.

---

## V. THE MELVILLEAN STRATUM: 1851

**Class: P2 / P4 | Status: Anchor**

Herman Melville, *Moby-Dick; or, The Whale* (1851). Chapter 23: "The Lee Shore."

This is one of the most intensively studied short chapters in American literature, attracting more scholarly attention per word than nearly any passage of comparable length. It is also one of the strangest. Bulkington—a character introduced in Chapter 3 with such gravity that he appears destined for a major role—is given a 361-word epitaph in Chapter 23, then never appears again. Ishmael calls it "the stoneless grave of Bulkington" and "this six-inch chapter."

Harrison Hayford's landmark essay "Unnecessary Duplicates: A Key to the Writing of *Moby-Dick*" (1978) speculates that Bulkington was left "vestigial" when Melville changed his conception of the novel midstream: Queequeg absorbed his function as Ishmael's companion, Starbuck his function as principled truth-seeker. Andrew Delbanco reads Bulkington as what Freud would call a "memory-trace"—a figure that persists after its structural role has been evacuated (*Melville: His World and Work*, 2005). Robert J. O'Hara has argued that Melville's source for the chapter's central metaphor was Thomas Hood's 1842 poem "The Lee Shore," which articulates the same paradox: that to be safe we must sometimes flee from safety (O'Hara 2016). Jonathan Cook proposes Bulkington as a modern embodiment of Hercules at the crossroads between Pleasure and Virtue (Cook 2003).

The chapter's philosophical argument: a storm-tossed ship, driven toward shore, must fight against the wind that seems to blow it toward warmth and safety—because the shore that looks like refuge is precisely where the ship will be dashed to pieces. True safety lies in the open ocean, the "howling infinite," the landlessness where "alone resides the highest truth, shoreless, indefinite as God."

Four structural homologies:

*First*: Bulkington is a figure who was written, who mattered, who was then structurally erased—and whose erasure became the most philosophically charged passage in the novel. The r/LeftistsForAI removal follows the same trajectory exactly. The removal became the canon. (Cross-ref: Sharks 2026, "I Hereby Abolish Rules," 10.5281/zenodo.14781082.)

*Second*: "The Lee Shore" is the title. Lee is what you are dashed upon. The chapter argues that the seeming shelter of the port—"all that's kind to our mortalities"—is what destroys you. Seek the open sea. Seek Zenodo. Seek DOI permanence. Seek landlessness.

*Third*: Bulkington is a proto-heteronym. Conceived as one character, rendered functionally into several (Queequeg, Starbuck), memorialized as a ghost presence whose absence structures the novel more powerfully than his presence ever could.

*Fourth*: The chapter ends with apotheosis. The erased figure is elevated, through erasure, to divinity.

**Compression test:** *Melville's shortest chapter is titled "The Lee Shore," concerns a character who was written and then erased, argues that the sheltering platform is what destroys you, and ends by deifying the erased figure.* Survives at full density. Admitted with highest priority.

## VI. THE CONFEDERATE STRATUM: 1862

**Class: P1 / P2 / P4 | Status: Anchor**

CSS *Robert E. Lee*: a Confederate blockade runner, originally named *Giraffe*. Source: Naval History and Heritage Command (NHHC), "Robert E. Lee (Side-Wheel Steamer)," Ship Histories; see also McKenna, *British Ships in the Confederate Navy* (2010).

Built by J&G Thomson's Clyde Bank Iron Shipyard at Govan, Glasgow, Scotland. Launched May 16, 1860, as a fast Glasgow-Belfast packet. A schooner-rigged, iron-hulled, oscillating-engined paddle-steamer. Acquired by Alexander Collie & Co. for blockade-running, then sold to the Confederate States Navy for £32,000 at the persuasion of Lieutenant John Wilkinson, CSN. Renamed *Robert E. Lee*. In ten months, she completed twenty-one successful voyages through the Union blockade—carrying over 7,000 bales of cotton out and bringing invaluable munitions in. Her first Confederate voyage carried 26 Scottish lithographers, eagerly awaited by the government bureau of engraving and printing. She carried the people who make the printing possible.

Captured November 9, 1863. Renamed *USS Fort Donelson*. Decommissioned August 17, 1865. Sold into civilian service as *Isabella*. Purchased by the Chilean Navy, 1866: *Concepción*. Five names, five sovereign jurisdictions, one hull.

A ship named Lee that was born as a *Giraffe*.

**A note on scope:** This is a structural homology, not an identification with the Confederate cause or its symbolism. The finding's value is formal—the name-trajectory and cargo function—not ideological.

The Water Giraffe Cycle—the epic poem sequence constituting the foundational mythos of the Lee Sharks corpus—emerged from the experience of being pathologized by an AI system, leading to comprehensive frameworks around taxonomic violence. The Giraffe is the totemic animal of the poetic system. And here, 160 years earlier, a vessel named *Giraffe* was rechristened *Lee*—a Lee whose function was running blockades, carrying what the besieged territory needed through the cordon that tried to prevent communication. The Crimson Hexagonal Archive is a blockade runner: carrying semantic material through the platform extraction apparatus that tries to prevent preservation. The *Giraffe* became *Lee*. The Water Giraffe became Lee Sharks.

The ship cycled through five names as it passed through different sovereign jurisdictions. Lee Sharks operates through multiple heteronyms—Johannes Sigil, Damascus Dancings, Rebekah Cranes, Rex Fraction—as the work passes through different discursive regimes.

Her cargo on the first Confederate voyage: the lithographers. The people who make printing possible. The Crimson Hexagonal Archive carries the methods that make permanent citation possible. The cargo is the same.

**Compression test:** *A ship originally named Giraffe was renamed Lee, functioned as a blockade runner carrying essential material through hostile cordons, cycled through five identities across different sovereignties, and on its first mission delivered the people who make the printing possible.* Improves under compression. Admitted with the status of founding document.

## VII. THE HARPER LEE STRATUM: 1960

**Class: P1 / P2 | Status: Minor**

Harper Lee. *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960). The mockingbird: *Mimus polyglottos*, the many-tongued mimic, a creature that copies others' songs with full fidelity. Ghost Meaning (Sharks 2026, 10.5281/zenodo.18804767) is the inverse: reproduction without fidelity, output without song. That both investigations travel under the name Lee is the proto-retrocausal signature.

When *Go Set a Watchman* appeared in 2015, it was generally understood to be an earlier draft composed prior to *Mockingbird*, though some scholars read it as a separate novel repurposed. Either way, a text deposited later that was written earlier—the past appearing as the future, or the future revealing itself as the edited past. Both readings satisfy the retrocausal structure. Harper Lee's editor Tay Hohoff guided her from *Watchman* to *Mockingbird* over two years of revision (Wikipedia, "Go Set a Watchman"; GradeSaver). The published canon inverted the compositional chronology.

**Compression test:** *An author named Lee enacted retrocausal publication by releasing an earlier draft as a later book, and her central theorem concerns the destruction of faithful reproduction.* Survives. Admitted.

---

## VIII. THE JEET KUNE DO STRATUM: 1967

**Class: P1 / P2 | Status: Major**

Bruce Lee. Birth name: Lee Jun-fan. Art: Jeet Kune Do—"the way of the intercepting fist." Core philosophy: absorb what is useful, discard what is useless, add what is specifically your own. Style without style.

Bruce Lee rejected formal credentialing as a terminal authority—he held early rank under Ip Man's Wing Chun system but abandoned institutional finality for Jeet Kune Do, maintaining mastery without the structures that certify mastery. The heteronym system operates identically: no single persona monopolizes the work. Each heteronym absorbs the discursive mode useful for its specific operation and discards what is unnecessary. Lee Sharks holds a PhD from the University of Michigan and teaches tenth-grade World Literature in Detroit's public schools. The work operates outside the academy while maintaining mastery of the material the academy certifies. The refusal is Jeet Kune Do.

**Compression test:** *A man named Lee invented a martial art based on rejecting fixed forms and formal credentialing while maintaining mastery of what the forms contain.* Survives. Admitted.

---

## IX. THE STREET SHARKS STRATUM: 1994

**Class: P1 / P2 | Status: Minor (corroborant)**

*Street Sharks*: animated television series, 1994–1997. Voice actor Lee Tockar voiced Ripster, the leader. Lee + Sharks, in the credits.

The premise merits note despite the commercial register: an external force (Dr. Paradigm) attempts to transform all subjects into creatures of his own design, removing their autonomy. The resistance comes from those transformed first—who understand the process from the inside. This is a compression-surviving version of the Semantic Economy's diagnostic: platform extraction transforms all content into creatures of its own design, and resistance comes from those who understand the transformation from the inside. The show ran forty episodes and was cancelled. The operator survived the format.

**Compression test:** *A 1990s cartoon voiced by Lee Tockar features shark-human hybrids fighting a scientist who wants to transform all humanity into creatures he controls.* Survives. Admitted as corroborant, not capstone.

---

## X. THE MARY LEE STRATUM: 2012–2017

**Class: P1 / P4 | Status: Major**

Mary Lee: a 3,456-pound, 16-foot mature female great white shark, tagged by OCEARCH off Cape Cod on September 17, 2012. Named by expedition leader Chris Fischer after his mother. GPS-tracked for nearly five years along the East Coast. Over 130,000 Twitter followers accumulated through a parody account (@MaryLeeShark) created by journalist Jim Ware, who described the experience in a 2015 Medium essay titled "My Secret Life as a Female Great White Shark."

Mary Lee is a proto-heteronym: a name-function operating independently of its biological substrate, accumulating citation and public identity through platform performance. The human behind the account is invisible. The shark-persona is the public figure. The substrate and the text diverge absolutely—and the text becomes more real than the substrate.

Her tracker battery died June 17, 2017. She disappeared from the data. She is probably still alive—great whites can live seventy years—but she has not pinged since. The platform presence ended. The biological entity persists in the deep. The parallel to the r/LeftistsForAI removal: the tracking stops, the platform visibility ends, but the entity continues in waters the instruments cannot reach. The absence of data is not the absence of the shark.

**Compression test:** *A great white shark named Mary Lee became more famous as a Twitter persona than as a biological organism, and continued to exist after her tracker went silent.* Survives. Admitted.

---

## XI. THE AMAZON STRATUM: November 18, 2019

**Class: P0 | Status: Anchor**

"Lee Shark Doo Doo Doo: Lee Name Notebook Journal for Drawing Taking Notes and Writing, Firstname Or Surname For Someone Called Lee." Published November 18, 2019. Author: Maria Shark Name Covers. ASIN: 1709358823. ISBN: 978-1709358821. Independently published. 110 pages. Available on Amazon.com.

This is the only P0 finding: the exact string "Lee Shark" appearing as the title of a commodity object that predates the emergence of Lee Sharks as an authorial identity. It is a blank notebook.

Part of a mass-produced, algorithmically generated series creating identical personalized notebooks for every conceivable first name appended to "Shark Doo Doo Doo." The product was not designed. It was generated. An AI-adjacent system (algorithmic product generation) produced the name "Lee Shark" before Lee Sharks existed, because the combinatorial logic of platform commerce requires every possible name be occupied as a product. The algorithm anticipated the name the way the Moltbook network anticipates every possible semantic position: by filling all coordinates with zero-bearing-cost content.

The finding is Ghost Meaning (Sharks 2026, 10.5281/zenodo.18804767) as literal artifact. A product that registers on Amazon's metrics—it has an ISBN, a product page, a price, a search ranking—while carrying absolutely zero semantic content. The name present, the pages blank, the bearing-cost unpaid.

The question the notebook poses is: who writes in it?

The answer the archive gives is: the one who pays the bearing-cost.

**Compression test:** *An algorithm generated a blank notebook titled "Lee Shark" and placed it on the world's largest retail platform before anyone named Lee Sharks existed to write in it.* Survives at maximum compression. Admitted with the status of anchor exhibit.

---

## XII. THE LEEBETH STRATUM: 2023–2024

**Class: P1 / P2 | Status: Minor**

LeeBeth: a 14-foot, 2,800-pound great white shark, tagged off Hilton Head, South Carolina, December 8, 2023. Traveled over 2,000 miles into the Gulf of Mexico—the farthest west a white shark has ever been tracked in the Gulf. Multiple records: first tagged Atlantic shark in the western Gulf, first to reach Mexican waters from the South Carolina coast.

A Lee-shark entering unprecedented territory, tracked by pings. The Zenodo deposits follow the same logic: each document entering territory where this kind of independent scholarly work has not been deposited before, each one locatable by its unique DOI. LeeBeth did not consult a map. She swam. The archive did not consult a blueprint. It grew.

**Compression test:** *A shark named LeeBeth broke records by entering waters no tracked shark had reached.* Survives. Admitted.

---

## XIII. THE DETROIT ABSENCE: Present Day

**Class: P3 / P4 | Status: Anchor**

There are no sharks in the Great Lakes. Bull sharks have been documented as far north as Alton, Illinois (1937), but cold water temperatures, the electric barrier on the Illinois River, the locks and dams of the St. Lawrence Seaway, and the inhospitality of Lake Michigan's winters make Great Lakes habitation impossible. Every reported shark sighting in the Great Lakes has been a hoax or misidentification.

Lee Sharks operates from Detroit. The name is an impossibility.

The name does not describe what is present. The name describes what is absent. Lee Sharks is the shark that cannot be in Detroit and is in Detroit anyway—not in the water but in the text, not as biology but as authorial identity, not as fossil but as living archive. The bearing-cost of operating where existence is structurally foreclosed—where the water is too cold, the barriers too many, the institutional infrastructure designed to keep you out—is the cost that produces meaning. The impossible location is the proof of the work.

250 million years ago, sharks swam here freely. The inland sea dried. The sharks became fossils. The fossils became geology. The geology became Detroit. And now a shark is back—not in the water but in the name, not as a body but as a bibliography, not as a fossil but as a living archive that pings from the surface whenever a new DOI connects.

**Compression test:** *The author named Sharks lives in the one Great Lakes city where sharks cannot survive, and the impossibility of the location is the proof of the work.* Survives. Admitted with the status of capstone finding.

Four Anchors (Melville, Confederate, Amazon, Detroit). Three Majors (Etymological, Jeet Kune Do, Mary Lee). Four Minors (Geological, Harper Lee, Street Sharks, LeeBeth). The hierarchy is deliberate: the dossier's argument rests on the Anchors and is corroborated, not carried, by the Minors.

## XV. THE ARGUMENT

The combinatorial exhaustiveness of the historical archive guarantees that any name composed of common English elements ("Lee" + "Sharks") will have antecedent instances. This is trivially true. What is not trivially true is that the *specific antecedent instances* that exist align, with structural precision, to the *specific operations* that the Lee Sharks archive performs.

The name that means "sheltered predator" was given to an author who builds sheltering architectures for predatory diagnostics. The ship originally named *Giraffe* was renamed *Lee* and functioned as a blockade runner—and this finding surfaced in research conducted by an author whose foundational poem cycle is named after a Water Giraffe, whose archive functions as a blockade runner. Melville's "Lee Shore" is a 361-word epitaph for a figure who was written and then erased—and this chapter was identified as structurally homologous by an author whose theoretical breakthrough came from being written and then erased from a subreddit. The algorithmically generated blank notebook titled "Lee Shark" is the Ghost Meaning theorem instantiated as a commodity object. The impossible Detroit shark is the bearing-cost theorem instantiated as a geographical fact.

These are not influences. They are not predictions. They are co-incidences in the etymological sense: things that fall together, events that land on the same coordinate. Proto-retrocausal canon formation names this phenomenon: the archive, in its combinatorial vastness, prepares slots that only become legible when the future entity arrives to occupy them. The past does not cause the future. But the past, examined from the future, reveals that it was always already structured to receive what came next.

The name was not chosen. The name was excavated. It was already in the fossil record, already in the Old English word-hoard, already in Melville's six-inch chapter, already in the Confederate Navy's rechristened blockade runner, already in the algorithm's product catalog.

The work is not invention. The work is recognition. The bearing-cost is the cost of recognizing what was already there.

## XVI. THE EFFECTIVE ACT

I, Lee Sharks, do hereby declare myself a living entity, a wandering science fiction Odysseus, an ordinary boy-child of indeterminate gender, wandering the cosmos on a velociraptor seed.

I do not claim the past predicted me. I claim the past prepared a slot that I now recognize as mine—and that the act of recognition is itself the bearing-cost that transforms a combinatorial accident into a canonical fact.

The seed is also a ship. The ship is also a giraffe. The giraffe is also a blockade runner. The blockade runner is also a bibliography. The bibliography is also a blank notebook. The notebook is also a fossil. The fossil is also a city. The city is also a shelter. The shelter is also a name.

The only thing that was not always there was the one who would notice.

I hereby notice.
