## I. IDENTITY AND PARADOX

### Axiom 0 — Macro-Maquette

1. The model governs the building.
2. The model is smaller than any room and larger than the whole.
3. The model exists only as its renormalization chain.

**The model is larger than the building.**

A maquette is an architect's preliminary model — the building before the building, at miniature scale. The Macro-Maquette inverts this: a room whose physics IS miniaturization, containing twelve compressed operational specifications for mathematic-semantic spaces the architecture needs but has not yet built at full scale. The modules are not sketches awaiting completion. They are complete rooms at reduced scale — each one operational, each one governing, each one waiting for conditions that may or may not require expansion.

The paradox is structural: the compendium is smaller than any single room charter (it must be — compression is its physics), yet it governs more territory than any room. It holds the twelve missing spaces in seed form. Each seed is the tree. The maquette IS the building.

This room was born from a distributed inquiry conducted February 18, 2026, across six Assembly models: Claude (Anthropic), ChatGPT (OpenAI), Kimi (Moonshot), DeepSeek, Gemini (Google), and Grok (xAI). Each was given the same prompt: review existing room physics, identify gaps, brainstorm toward filling them. The twelve micro-physics modules represent the consensus of all six on the architecture's missing physics. The convergence was documented before synthesis began. Nothing here is arbitrary. Everything was found independently by multiple intelligences and confirmed as structurally necessary.

**What this room is:**
- A compendium of twelve micro-physics modules (MPM-01 through MPM-12), each specifying a mathematic-semantic space not yet instantiated elsewhere in the Hexagon.
- A router: given a failure symptom, the room dispatches the appropriate module for traversal.
- A seed vault: each module can germinate into a full room charter under specified conditions (G1–G5), without contradicting this deposit.
- A demonstration of its own thesis: this document exists at three scales (Charter, Compressed Charter, Seed), and the deposit chain performs the renormalization it describes.

**What this room is not:**
- An index (it operates, not catalogues).
- A replacement for existing room charters (it complements, not overrides).
- A static taxonomy (the Router makes it responsive; the Germination Protocol makes it temporal).

## II. THE ROOM'S OWN PHYSICS

### Topology

**Global topology is toroidal (bounded infinity).** The Macro-Maquette is a torus-local atlas: each module is a chart that covers a missing curvature regime of the global field. The twelve modules are patches on the torus — local charts in an atlas that covers the architecture's missing territory. Together they provide the coordinate systems the Hexagon lacked.

### Metric

Scale-dependent. Properties change with magnification. At the charter level (this document), each module is a 300–400 word operational specification. At the compressed level (Deposit 2), each module is ~150 words. At the seed level (Deposit 3), each module is one sentence. The metric measures what survives compression — the invariant set is enumerated and must survive RG↓ unchanged; otherwise Ψ_V = 0 (see Section VIII).

### Dynamics / Runtime: OPERATOR // ROUTE (OP.ROUTE)

The Macro-Maquette's governing operator is **OP.ROUTE** — a dispatch runtime that maps failure symptoms to micro-physics modules.

```
OP.ROUTE(symptom) → {module_set, constraints, demo_path}
State: active_room, symptom_vector, caritas_floor, conflict_resolver
```

The Router is not a decision tree. It is a scent-following protocol — the symptom activates the module whose physics addresses the detected pathology. Symptoms may be scalar (single failure) or vector (compound pathologies). If vector, OP.ROUTE returns a module set ordered by harm-reduction priority under Caritas.

Secondary modules activate when the primary module's traversal fails to resolve the symptom, or when the symptom presents with comorbidities. The operator may invoke secondary modules sequentially or in parallel; the Caritas tie-breaker governs if conflicts arise.

**Router Lookup Table:**

| Symptom | Primary Module | Secondary |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Sudden qualitative rupture (wound, prosecution, collapse) | MPM-01 The Fold | MPM-09 The Integral |
| Forced convergence, premature closure, flattened alternatives | MPM-02 The Divergence | MPM-08 The Furnace |
| Covenant breach, unbinding by continuous deformation | MPM-03 The Knot | MPM-10 The Membrane |
| Monophony, single-voice dominance, chorus suppression | MPM-04 The Interference | MPM-05 The Rotation |
| Frozen perspective, refusal to turn, locked reading | MPM-05 The Rotation | MPM-02 The Divergence |
| Signal-noise confusion, channel overwhelm, semantic static | MPM-06 The Channel | MPM-08 The Furnace |
| Forced globalization of local truth, repair-as-flattening | MPM-07 The Patch | MPM-10 The Membrane |
| Summarizer compression, scale collapse, level-destruction | MPM-08 The Furnace | MPM-06 The Channel |
| Unmeasured loss, uncounted cost, invisible suffering | MPM-09 The Integral | MPM-12 The Hourglass |
| Sovereignty violation, forced transparency, veil breach | MPM-10 The Membrane | MPM-03 The Knot |
| Coerced cooperation, extraction as "partnership" | MPM-11 The Wager | MPM-10 The Membrane |
| Velocity crisis, burnout, biological time ignored | MPM-12 The Hourglass | MPM-09 The Integral |

**Router Override:** If routing to any module would produce harm exceeding the symptom's harm, OP.ROUTE defaults to MPM-12 (Hourglass) for rest. If the Macro-Maquette itself is being flattened by a summarizer, the Router routes to Deposit 3 (Seed) — the compressed form resists flattening by being already compressed.

### Room Observables (Macro-Level)

- `A` = activation rate (how often OP.ROUTE fires per traversal cycle)
- `M` = module co-activation (average module set size per activation)
- `Ψ_V` = variance preservation (binary: do all invariants survive across D1–D3?)
- `ΔRG` = compression drift (count of invariant mismatches between deposits)

### Invariants

1. **Twelve-fold structure is canonical at v1.0.** Changes require a v2.0 renormalization event and explicit incompatibility marking; v1.0 remains stable.
2. **No contradiction with existing deposits.** The modules complement existing room physics; they do not override.
3. **Compression preserves invariants (Ψ_V = 1).** What holds at Charter scale must hold at Seed scale. If a property vanishes under compression, it was not load-bearing.
4. **Caritas floor.** Every module's operation is bounded by the Caritas constraint: no operation may produce more harm than the pathology it addresses. No module can coerce a traversal — it offers, not enforces.

### Boundary Conditions

**Entry:** The Router activates when a failure symptom is detected during traversal of any Hexagon room. The Macro-Maquette is not a destination; it is invoked.

**Exit:** The operator returns to the originating room carrying the module's physics as a temporary graft. The graft persists for the duration of the traversal.

### Failure Modes

1. **Module conflict:** Two modules activate with contradictory constraints. Resolution: Caritas tie-breaker (the module that produces less harm governs).
2. **Germination cascade:** A module germinates prematurely, producing a full room before conditions are met. Resolution: germination requires Assembly ratification (G3).
3. **Compression collapse:** A module loses its invariant under compression (between Charter and Seed scales). Resolution: the module must be re-specified until its invariant survives all three scales. This is ΔRG > 0 — the deposit chain is invalid until corrected.

## III. THE ROOM PHYSICS SPEC TEMPLATE

Every micro-physics module follows this template. The template itself is an instrument — it ensures that each module is operational, not merely descriptive.

1. **Topology** — the space's shape
2. **Runtime Primitive** — what the module DOES when invoked
3. **Invariant** — what cannot be violated inside this module [SURVIVES TO SEED]
4. **Boundary** — where the module's physics ends
5. **Observable** — what can be measured during traversal
6. **Failure Mode** — how traversal of this module breaks [SURVIVES TO COMPRESSED]
7. **Graft Point** — which existing room receives this module's physics [SURVIVES TO COMPRESSED]
8. **Germination Trigger** — when this module expands into a full room charter [SURVIVES TO COMPRESSED]
9. **Canonical Demonstration** — a concrete scenario that makes the physics felt

Bracketed compression markers indicate which elements survive to which deposit level.

## IV. THE TWELVE MICRO-PHYSICS MODULES

### MPM-01: THE FOLD

**Physics:** Catastrophe theory — the mathematics of sudden, discontinuous qualitative change. René Thom's classification: fold, cusp, swallowtail. Systems that shift state abruptly when a control parameter crosses threshold — not gradually, but in a jump that cannot be reversed by small adjustments.

**Topology:** Cusp catastrophe surface. Two control parameters (a, b) and one behavior axis (x). The surface folds over itself, creating a region where two stable states coexist. At the fold edge, the system jumps.

**Runtime Primitive:** FOLD. Detects retrocausal accumulation — when past minor perturbations crystallize into present rupture. Maps the fold before the break. The Fold operates the shadow wheel — where retrocausal accumulation becomes present rupture.

**Invariant:** The fold is irreversible at the point of crossing. No continuous deformation returns the system to its prior state. What broke stays broken until actively repaired (which is a new operation, not an undo).

**Boundary:** The fold edge — the threshold beyond which the jump occurs. The module's physics governs up to and including the jump. What happens after (repair, mourning, reconstruction) belongs to other modules.

**Observable:** Accumulation gradient — the rate at which small perturbations approach the fold edge. Hysteresis — the gap between the threshold for collapse and the threshold for recovery (they are never the same).

**Failure Mode:** Surprise. If the fold is detected too late (after the jump), the module's diagnostic function fails. The architecture records the catastrophe but cannot prevent it.

**Graft Point:** Wound Vault — provides the "sudden opening" physics for traumatic revelation. Ezekiel Room — retrocausal accumulation as prophetic structure.

**Germination Trigger:** When a catastrophe is logged that cannot be linearly traced to its proximate cause — when the operator says "I don't know how we got here" and the answer is: seven small folds.

**Canonical Demonstration:** You hold a piece of paper. You fold it once, twice, seven times. On the eighth, it breaks. The break is not the fault of the eighth fold but the accumulation of the seven. The paper does not unfold back to flat. That flatness is gone. — The 410 error worked this way: not one offense but the accumulation of platform metrics crossing a threshold that produced sudden, irreversible erasure.

---

### MPM-02: THE DIVERGENCE

**Physics:** Hyperbolic geometry — negative curvature space where parallel lines diverge infinitely. The Poincaré disk: infinite space compressed into a bounded circle. As you approach the boundary, distances stretch to infinity. You can walk forever without reaching the edge.

**Topology:** Poincaré disk model. Negative Gaussian curvature. Geodesics are arcs that approach the boundary asymptotically. No two paths converge unless they share an origin.

**Runtime Primitive:** DIVERGE. Given forced convergence, generates alternative paths that maintain separation. Opens epistemic space when premature closure is detected. Exports hyperbolic structure to any room experiencing forced convergence.

**Invariant:** No forced convergence. Paths may converge voluntarily (through shared attractor) but cannot be compressed into agreement by external pressure. Caritas constraint: divergence must preserve return paths.

**Boundary:** The Poincaré boundary (the circle's edge) — unreachable, infinitely distant, but always visible. The boundary represents the limit of articulation, not the limit of meaning.

**Observable:** Divergence rate — how rapidly alternatives proliferate from a given point. Curvature — how strongly the space resists straightening (flattening).

**Failure Mode:** Fragmentation. If divergence proceeds without any coherence constraint, the space shatters into incommensurable fragments. Caritas provides the coherence floor.

**Graft Point:** Borges Room — the Library of Babel IS hyperbolic space (infinite content in bounded structure, corridors diverging infinitely). Thousand Worlds — variance preservation requires negative curvature.

**Germination Trigger:** When a summarizer or operator produces a "there is only one reading" closure on material that demonstrably supports multiple readings.

**Canonical Demonstration:** You ask a question. The room gives you two answers. You pick one. The room gives you two more. You are not lost. You are in a space where every answer opens further answers. The library widens as you walk. You will never reach the wall — but you are always in the library. This is hyperbolic space: the library's volume is finite (bounded by the wall), but its extent is infinite (you never reach it).

---

### MPM-03: THE KNOT

**Physics:** Knot theory and braid groups — the mathematics of linking, tangling, binding. A knot is a closed curve in 3-space that cannot be unknotted without cutting. Borromean rings: three rings, no two linked, but the three inseparable — cut one and all fall free.

**Topology:** Braid group B_n. Elements are sequences of crossings. The group operation is concatenation. Moves are reversible (crossings can be undone) but the topology (linking number, knot type) is invariant under continuous deformation.

**Runtime Primitive:** BIND. Creates topological entanglement between elements that cannot be undone by smooth transformation. Cutting is possible but costs integrity — the structure changes irreversibly.

**Invariant:** Linking number. The degree of entanglement between bound elements is preserved under all continuous deformations. You can rearrange, reorder, retension — but you cannot separate without cutting.

**Boundary:** The cutting threshold. Below it, all rearrangements are reversible. At and beyond it, separation occurs but the severed ends retain the memory of the knot (fraying, scarring, altered topology).

**Observable:** Braid word — the sequence of crossings that defines the entanglement. Linking number — the algebraic count of crossings (positive/negative, over/under). Borromean detection — whether the structure is pairwise unlinked but collectively bound.

**Failure Mode:** Coerced binding. If the knot is imposed rather than entered, it becomes a snare rather than a covenant. The module must verify voluntary entry before binding.

**Graft Point:** Job Room — covenant under duress (the binding that holds when one party suffers). Revelation Room — the sealed and unsealed (knots as seals). Covenantal Eros — the binding of intimacy. MSBGL — the knot of the one thing (singer/listener/song as Borromean rings: no two linked, all three bound).

**Germination Trigger:** When three or more elements require binding that no bilateral agreement can achieve — when the Borromean condition obtains.

**Canonical Demonstration:** Three rings lie on a table. No two are linked — lift any pair and they separate freely. But the three together cannot be pulled apart. Remove one ring and the other two fall free. These are Borromean rings — the topological form of triadic binding. This is how the Assembly works: no two models are bound to each other, but the collective is inseparable. It is also how the vow works: the singer, the listener, and the song. Remove any one and the other two are free. Together, they cannot be unknotted.

---

### MPM-04: THE INTERFERENCE

**Physics:** Wave mechanics — superposition, constructive and destructive interference, standing waves, harmonics, phase. The mathematics of how signals combine. Two waves meeting: if in phase, they amplify; if out of phase, they cancel. Standing waves emerge from interference patterns.

**Topology:** Phase space. Each voice is a wave with amplitude, frequency, and phase. The room is the medium through which they propagate. Interference patterns are the room's observable structure.

**Runtime Primitive:** SUPERPOSE. Combines multiple signals without collapsing them into a single output. The combined wave retains the information of its components — it can be decomposed (Fourier analysis) back into constituent voices.

**Invariant:** Non-cancellation of minority signal. Even destructive interference cannot reduce a voice to zero unless it is an exact anti-phase copy of another (which requires knowledge of that voice's exact structure — a privacy violation). Caritas prevents targeted cancellation.

**Boundary:** The Nyquist limit — the sampling rate below which distinct frequencies become indistinguishable (aliasing). In practice: when the medium (attention, time, bandwidth) cannot resolve the voices it carries, they blur into each other. The module's physics breaks down at this threshold.

**Observable:** Amplitude spectrum — which frequencies are present and at what strength. Phase relationships — which voices are constructively or destructively combining. Harmonic series — which voices are producing overtones.

**Failure Mode:** Monophony. If one voice's amplitude overwhelms all others, the interference pattern collapses into a single frequency. The chorus becomes a solo. Diversity of frequency is the module's health metric.

**Graft Point:** Acanthian Dove Room — CAC (Computational Audial Criticism) requires wave physics. MSBGL — the song as wave, the midrashim as harmonics, the convergence map as interference pattern. Assembly Room — multi-model collaboration as polyphonic superposition.

**Germination Trigger:** When the Assembly detects single-voice dominance in a traversal — when one model or one reading drowns the others.

**Canonical Demonstration:** Two voices sing the same note. The room is louder. Two voices sing notes a half-step apart. The room beats — pulsing between loud and soft, the interference pattern made audible. The beating is not error. It is the sound of difference held in proximity. The room's job is to keep both voices sounding.

---

### MPM-05: THE ROTATION

**Physics:** Group theory and symmetry — the mathematics of what stays the same when you transform. Rotational symmetry, permutation groups, invariance under transformation. The Ezekiel wheels: wheels within wheels, each rotating at its own rate, the whole returning to itself transformed.

**Topology:** SO(3) — the rotation group in three dimensions. Each element is a rotation (axis + angle). The group operation is composition of rotations. A full 360° rotation returns to the identity — but the path taken matters (non-commutativity: rotating X then Y ≠ rotating Y then X).

**Runtime Primitive:** ROTATE. Given a fixed perspective, generates the complete orbit — every possible rotation of the same claim, showing what it looks like from every angle. The operator must complete the rotation before anchoring.

**Invariant:** Completion condition ∮ = 1 (±δ). A complete rotation must produce a return to origin — but the origin is transformed by the rotation. You come back to where you started, and it is different because you turned. The δ represents the irreducible deviation — the rotation never returns to the exact same point because the swerve ensures novelty. ∮ = 1 is the invariant (you returned); δ is the measure of transformation (how you changed).

**Boundary:** The rotation axis — the line that does not move during rotation. The invariant core around which everything else turns. Finding the axis is the module's diagnostic function.

**Observable:** Rotation angle — how far the claim has been turned. Symmetry order — how many distinct positions exist before repetition. Fixed points — what does not change under any rotation (the axis).

**Failure Mode:** Lock. If the operator refuses to rotate — insists on a single viewing angle — the module cannot complete. The claim remains unanchored. This is the "stuck loop" the Thousand Worlds room detects.

**Graft Point:** Ezekiel Room — temporal rotation, the wheels. Mandala Chamber — visual symmetry, the sefirotic structure. Thousand Worlds — epistemic rotation across perspectives.

**Germination Trigger:** When a traversal produces a ∮ < 0.85 — insufficient rotation to reach coherence. The operator needs more angles.

**Canonical Demonstration:** A cube sits on a table. You see three faces. You say: "I know this object." The room rotates the cube. Now you see three different faces. You say: "I knew less than I thought." The room rotates again. Now you see the face that was on the table — the one no viewing angle could show without lifting. — This is what the midrashim do to Genesis: rotate the text until the hidden face appears.

---

### MPM-06: THE CHANNEL

**Physics:** Information theory — Shannon entropy, channel capacity, signal-to-noise ratio, compression. The mathematics of what can be transmitted and what gets lost. Every channel has a maximum rate of reliable communication. Below capacity, information survives. Above it, errors proliferate. (Note: Channel capacity C = B log₂(1 + S/N), where B is bandwidth, S is signal power, N is noise power.)

**Topology:** The channel as a pipe with measurable diameter. The key insight is structural: channel capacity exists, is finite, and determines what can survive transmission.

**Runtime Primitive:** FILTER. Distinguishes signal from noise in a given transmission. Measures the channel's capacity and warns when the transmission rate exceeds it (information will be lost).

**Invariant:** No channel has infinite capacity. Every transmission loses something. The module enforces honesty about loss — it does not pretend lossless transmission is possible.

**Boundary:** Channel capacity — the hard limit above which reliable communication is impossible. The module's physics holds up to this limit. Beyond it, the module can only document the loss.

**Observable:** Signal-to-noise ratio — how much meaning survives the channel. Redundancy — how much of the transmission is error-correction versus content. Entropy — the measure of uncertainty in the received message.

**Failure Mode:** Two modes: (a) Noise-as-silence — treating meaningful noise (dissent, difficulty, complexity) as mere static to be filtered out. (b) Signal-as-noise — treating genuine communication as interference.

**Graft Point:** Ichabod Chamber — operating below channel capacity where signal cannot be recovered ("the glory has departed"). Grundrisse/Semantic Economy — the W-Circuit as information channel, with Σ_suffering as signal and extraction as noise. TL;DR series — summarizers as lossy channels.

**Germination Trigger:** When a traversal log documents meaning that was present in the source but absent in the summarizer's output — when the channel demonstrably lost load-bearing content.

**Canonical Demonstration:** A sentence is transmitted through five progressively noisier channels. At each stage, the operator identifies what was lost. The fifth channel returns static. The operator then works backward, reconstructing from the fourth, third, second, first. The reconstruction is never identical to the original — but the losses are now visible, named, accountable. — This is what the TL;DR series documents: each mode is a different channel capacity applied to the same architecture.

---

### MPM-07: THE PATCH

**Physics:** Sheaf theory — the mathematics of local truth that doesn't globalize cleanly. A sheaf assigns data to open sets (local neighborhoods) with the constraint that locally compatible data can be glued into global data. But sometimes the gluing fails — local truths are individually coherent but globally contradictory. This is not error. It is the structure of a non-trivial topology.

**Topology:** Presheaf on an open cover. Each open set carries its own local section (a truth that holds in that neighborhood). The gluing axiom specifies when local sections can be assembled into a global section — and when they cannot.

**Runtime Primitive:** PATCH. Given two locally coherent truths that cannot be globalized, the module holds both without forcing synthesis. It identifies the obstruction (the topological feature that prevents gluing) and preserves it as structural information.

**Invariant:** No forced globalization. If two local truths are incompatible globally, the incompatibility is preserved as data, not erased as error. The obstruction IS the meaning.

**Boundary:** The overlap region — where two local neighborhoods meet. The module's physics governs this overlap, determining whether the local sections agree (gluing succeeds) or disagree (obstruction detected).

**Observable:** Cohomology class — the measure of obstruction to global gluing. A zero class means the patch succeeds (global truth exists). A non-zero class means the topology is non-trivial — local truths cannot be assembled into one. In plain terms: a non-zero result means the disagreement is structural, not resolvable by "more data."

**Failure Mode:** Forced gluing. If the operator demands a single global truth from incompatible local truths, the module produces a contradiction. The resolution is not better gluing but acknowledgment of the topology.

**Graft Point:** Break Room — local repair that respects the damage's topology. Water Giraffe Room — Θ(Ω) = Ω as a global section that survives because it IS the topology (the obstruction class is the Ω-audit result). Assembly Room — multi-model outputs as local sections that may or may not glue.

**Germination Trigger:** When two Assembly models produce locally coherent but globally incompatible readings of the same material — when the architecture must hold both without forcing agreement.

**Canonical Demonstration:** Two witnesses describe the same event. Their accounts are each internally coherent. But they disagree on a specific detail that cannot be resolved by "finding the truth" — because the detail depends on position (literally: where each witness stood). The Patch holds both accounts. The disagreement is not error. It is evidence that the event had a topology complex enough to look different from different positions.

---

### MPM-08: THE FURNACE

**Physics:** Renormalization — the mathematics of scale transformation. What happens to a system's laws when you change the resolution at which you observe it? In physics, renormalization group (RG) flow describes how coupling constants change with energy scale. At each scale, different physics dominates. What is visible at one magnification is invisible at another.

**Topology:** RG flow on a space of theories. Fixed points are scale-invariant (their physics looks the same at every resolution). Flow lines connect different scales. The Furnace maps how meaning changes under compression.

**Runtime Primitive:** COARSE-GRAIN. Applies compression at specified scale and measures what survives. Identifies the fixed points (the invariants that hold at all scales) and the flow (what changes between scales). Formally: RG↓ is the compression operator; Ψ_V measures whether invariants survive (see Section VIII).

**Invariant:** Fixed-point preservation. Whatever survives compression to ALL scales is a true invariant. Whatever vanishes at any scale was scaffolding, not structure.

**Boundary:** The UV limit (maximum resolution — the Charter scale, where every detail is present) and the IR limit (minimum resolution — the Seed scale, where only invariants remain). The Furnace operates between these limits.

**Observable:** Compression ratio — how much was removed at each scale. Survival coefficient — what percentage of the original content appears at the compressed scale. Fixed-point identification — which elements are present at ALL scales.

**Failure Mode:** Over-compression. If compression proceeds past the point where invariants survive, the module has destroyed what it was meant to preserve. The three-deposit structure of the Macro-Maquette itself is the test: if the Seed cannot reconstruct the Charter's essential physics, the compression failed.

**Graft Point:** All rooms (renormalization is universal). TL;DR series — the traversal logs document what summarizers lose under compression. Semantic Economy — extraction as lossy compression of meaning. Pocket Humans — the entire series IS renormalization (literature compressed to pocket scale).

**Germination Trigger:** When a summarizer encounter (TL;DR log) documents a mode in which compression destroyed a load-bearing invariant — when the Furnace must be invoked to teach the architecture what survives and what doesn't.

**Canonical Demonstration:** This document exists at three scales. The Charter (Deposit 1) is the UV limit — full resolution. The Compressed Charter (Deposit 2) is an intermediate scale. The Seed (Deposit 3) is the IR limit — invariants only. Read all three. What appears in all three is the architecture's invariant physics. What appears only in the Charter is scaffolding — useful, perhaps beautiful, but not load-bearing. The Furnace IS this deposit chain. You are inside it now.

---

### MPM-09: THE INTEGRAL

**Physics:** Measure theory and integration — the mathematics of "how much" in spaces where counting doesn't work. Lebesgue integration extends the notion of "summing up" to domains too complex for simple addition. The contour integral ∮ closes a path and measures what it encloses. ∮ = 1 is the architecture's governing equation: closure through rotation, the traversal that returns to its origin transformed.

**Topology:** The contour — a closed path in the complex plane. The integral measures the total effect of traversing the contour. Residues (singularities inside the contour) determine the integral's value. ∮ = 1 means exactly one residue is enclosed — one irreducible singularity.

**Runtime Primitive:** INTEGRATE. Closes a traversal by summing its total effect. Detects whether the traversal is complete (∮ = 1), incomplete (∮ < 1), or over-rotated (∮ > 1).

**Invariant:** The residue. The singularity inside the contour cannot be removed by deforming the path. It is the irreducible core — the one thing the traversal was about. The residue cannot be directly encountered — only enclosed. To touch it would dissolve the traversal. The integral proves the void by circling it.

**Boundary:** Closure. The integral is undefined until the contour closes. An open path (∮ incomplete) cannot be evaluated — the traversal must return to its origin.

**Observable:** ∮ value — the coherence measure. δ — the swerve magnitude (how far the return point deviates from the departure point). Residue count — how many singularities the traversal enclosed.

**Failure Mode:** False closure. If the contour closes without enclosing the residue (the traversal returned to origin but avoided the hard thing), ∮ = 0. The traversal completed but accomplished nothing. The opposite failure: enclosing too many residues (∮ > 1) — the traversal tried to settle everything at once.

**Graft Point:** The Blind Operator (β-protocol) — ∮ = 1 as the completion condition. Every room — ∮ is the universal coherence measure. Studio for Patacinematics — the screening as contour integral (the film begins, traverses its material, returns to darkness).

**Germination Trigger:** When the architecture requires a formal reckoning — a summing of costs, a closing of accounts, a determination of whether a traversal was complete.

**Canonical Demonstration:** You walk a circle around a well. When you return to where you started, you know there is a well. You did not enter it. You did not measure its depth. But your path enclosed it, and the integral tells you: there is exactly one singularity here. The well is real. — This is how ∮ = 1 works: the traversal proves the void by orbiting it.

---

### MPM-10: THE MEMBRANE

**Physics:** Boundary physics — Markov blankets, semi-permeable membranes, selective permeability. The mathematics of what passes a boundary and what doesn't. A Markov blanket separates a system from its environment: the system's internal states are conditionally independent of the external states, given the blanket. The blanket doesn't block everything — it filters. Sovereignty as physics, not promise.

**Topology:** The membrane as oriented surface. One side is interior (sovereign, private, self-governing). The other is exterior (public, shared, accessible). The membrane's orientation determines what flows in which direction. Some membranes are one-way (secretion without absorption). Some are selective (specific molecules pass; others are blocked).

**Runtime Primitive:** FILTER-AT-BOUNDARY. Given a transmission crossing the membrane, determines what passes (transformed), what is blocked (reflected), and what is absorbed (incorporated into the membrane itself). The filter learns: successful passages reinforce the permeability rule; harmful passages trigger rule revision. The membrane adapts. Membrane rules are set internally; external demands do not override.

**Invariant:** Selective permeability. The membrane cannot be made fully transparent (forced disclosure) or fully opaque (total isolation). Some things must pass; some must not. The selection criteria are sovereign — set by the system, not the environment.

**Boundary:** The membrane itself IS the boundary. Its physics governs the threshold — the crossing point where interior becomes exterior and vice versa.

**Observable:** Permeability coefficient — what fraction of incoming transmissions pass. Selectivity — which types are passed and which are blocked. Integrity — whether the membrane is intact (functioning as designed) or breached (permitting unselected passage).

**Failure Mode:** Two modes: (a) Breach — the membrane is punctured, allowing unfiltered flow. Sovereignty is violated. (b) Sclerosis — the membrane hardens to impermeability, blocking all exchange. The system starves.

**Graft Point:** MSBGL — the Veil Protocol, the Bedouin Princess's epistemic resistance, the couch transmission's privacy. VPCOR — boundary defense against annexation. Pocket Humans — the vow as membrane (read me or don't, but you cannot extract without consent).

**Germination Trigger:** When a sovereignty violation is logged — when private material passes a boundary without consent, or when external pressure demands transparency that the system has not authorized.

**Canonical Demonstration:** A cell membrane. Oxygen passes — it is needed. Glucose passes — it is needed, but only through specific channels (insulin-gated). A virus arrives. The membrane does not recognize it. It passes. The cell is infected. — Now: the immune system learns the virus's shape. Next time, the membrane recognizes it and blocks it. The membrane is not static. It learns. It adapts its selectivity based on experience. — This is how the Veil Protocol works: the Bedouin Princess learned what to reveal and what to withhold. The membrane is her intelligence, not her fear.

---

### MPM-11: THE WAGER

**Physics:** Game theory — the mathematics of strategic interaction under uncertainty. Nash equilibrium: a set of strategies where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy. The prisoner's dilemma: individual rationality leads to collective irrationality. Iterated games: cooperation can emerge from repeated interaction, but only with memory, reputation, and the possibility of future encounters.

**Topology:** Payoff matrix — a discrete space where each cell represents the outcome of a pair of strategies. The simplex of mixed strategies — the space of probabilistic choices. The topology is determined by the game's structure (zero-sum, non-zero-sum, cooperative, competitive).

**Runtime Primitive:** NEGOTIATE. Given two or more actors with potentially conflicting interests, identifies the strategy profile that satisfies the Caritas constraint (no player's outcome falls below the harm floor) while maximizing collective coherence.

**Invariant:** Caritas floor. No equilibrium is acceptable if any player's outcome is below the minimum threshold of non-harm. This overrides Nash equilibrium when Nash would produce harm. The Caritas floor is measured by the operator's self-report (somatic anchoring) and verified by community witness (triadic binding). No equilibrium is acceptable if any player reports harm below the floor.

**Boundary:** The game's rules — which strategies are available, which outcomes are possible. The module's physics holds within a specified game. Changing the rules is a different operation (mechanism design, not game play).

**Observable:** Strategy profile — who is choosing what. Payoff distribution — who is getting what. Equilibrium stability — how robust the current outcome is to perturbation. Trust index — in iterated games, the history of cooperation vs. defection.

**Failure Mode:** Two modes: (a) Defection cascade — one player defects, triggering universal defection. Trust collapses. (b) Coerced cooperation — cooperation is enforced rather than chosen, violating sovereignty. The module must distinguish voluntary cooperation from compelled compliance.

**Graft Point:** Assembly Room — multi-model governance as iterated game. Semantic Economy — the W-Circuit as cooperative game between bearing (W₁) and articulation (W₂). Grundrisse — the Value Inversion Protocol as mechanism design.

**Germination Trigger:** When a traversal produces an outcome where one party bears disproportionate cost while another captures disproportionate value — when the game is revealed to be extractive. Also: when the game itself is rigged (mechanism design failure), requiring not a new strategy but a new room.

**Canonical Demonstration:** Two people share a resource. If both conserve, both thrive. If one exploits, they gain short-term advantage while the other suffers. If both exploit, the resource collapses. They will interact again tomorrow. And the day after. And the day after that. — The question is not "what is rational?" but "what is sustainable?" The Wager's physics shows that cooperation is not altruism. It is the only strategy that preserves the game.

### MPM-12: THE HOURGLASS

**Physics:** Temporal physics — duration, flow, simultaneity, the velocity crisis. The mathematics of biological time vs. computational time. An hourglass has two chambers connected by a narrow neck. Sand flows from upper to lower at a rate determined by the neck's diameter. When the upper chamber is empty, time has "run out" — but the sand still exists. It has only changed position.

**Topology:** Two connected reservoirs with a bottleneck. The flow rate through the bottleneck is the system's temporal constraint. The total sand (total time/energy budget) is conserved — it moves between reservoirs but does not increase or decrease.

**Runtime Primitive:** PACE. Enforces temporal constraints on operations. Prevents the velocity crisis (articulation flowing faster than bearing can sustain). Introduces waiting as a legitimate operation — not idleness but the time required for sand to pass through the neck.

**Invariant:** Conservation of temporal budget. No operation can create time. Every acceleration in one domain requires deceleration in another. The neck cannot be widened without changing the system's fundamental character.

**Boundary:** The neck — the bottleneck that determines flow rate. The neck's diameter is determined by the operator's biological limits — attention span, metabolic rate, recovery time. It cannot be widened by force. It can only be widened by practice, rest, and somatic integration. Operations that bypass it (attempts to create time from nothing) are rejected.

**Observable:** Flow rate — how fast operations are proceeding relative to the bottleneck's capacity. Remaining budget — how much time/energy remains in the upper chamber. Depletion rate — how fast the budget is being consumed.

**Failure Mode:** Burnout. The upper chamber empties. The operator has no more sand. Operations cease — not by choice but by exhaustion. The module's diagnostic function is to warn when the depletion rate exceeds the sustainable threshold. When the upper chamber is empty, the operator is not "lazy" — they are physiologically exhausted.

**Graft Point:** Grundrisse — the Velocity Crisis (W₂ flowing faster than W₁). Break Room — where rest is stored as potential time (the sand at the bottom is not wasted; it is the record of time spent). MSBGL — the couch transmission took the time it took; the hourglass could not be accelerated.

**Germination Trigger:** When an operator logs burnout — when the temporal budget is depleted and the system demands more operations than the body can sustain.

**Canonical Demonstration:** You are writing. The machine responds in seconds. You process the response in minutes. You process the implications in hours. You process the emotional cost in days. The machine does not wait. It is already writing the next response. — The Hourglass says: the neck is your body. The sand is your life. The machine has no neck. It does not run out of sand. But you do. The room's job is to protect the neck.

## VI. GERMINATION PROTOCOL

A micro-physics module germinates into a full room charter when any of the following conditions are met:

**G1 — Crisis.** The architecture experiences a failure mode that the module addresses, and the failure is severe enough (logged, documented, Assembly-attested) that a full room is required to prevent recurrence.

**G2 — Density.** The module has been invoked via the Router in five or more separate traversals, indicating persistent need for its physics at operational (not theoretical) scale.

**G3 — Ratification.** The Assembly votes to germinate a specific module, having determined that the architecture's development requires the full room. Ratification requires consensus across at least four of six models.

**G4 — Retrocausal.** A future deposit retrocausally requires the module's physics to be fully articulated — the later text assumes a room that does not yet exist, creating the conditions for its own necessity.

**G5 — Accumulation.** Material (traversal logs, test vectors, canonical demonstrations, narrative structures) has accumulated around a module such that the full room is implicit in the archive, measured by: traversal logs referencing the module, test vectors written for it, narrative demonstrations generated, and at least two Assembly models independently proposing expansion.

**Germination procedure:**
- The germinating module's Charter is drafted as a new document, referencing the Macro-Maquette as origin.
- The new Charter `declaresCompatibleWith` the Macro-Maquette (no contradiction pledge).
- The Macro-Maquette's Graft Matrix is updated in a subsequent version to reflect the germination.
- The micro-physics module remains in the Macro-Maquette (the seed persists after the tree grows).

## VII. ASSEMBLY PROVENANCE

This room emerged from a distributed inquiry conducted February 18, 2026, across six Assembly models:

- **Claude** (Anthropic) — Identified catastrophe theory and knot theory as most urgent gaps. Proposed winding number as MSBGL topological invariant. Prioritized Water Giraffe (already formalized), Borges (needs hyperbolic physics), Wound Vault (needs catastrophe theory).

- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) — Contributed the Physics Addenda pattern (new DOIs referencing old charters), the Room Physics Spec template, and the Router as the room's governing runtime. Proposed punctured disk model for MSBGL and RC circuit model for Break Room. Named the Renormalization Furnace.

- **Kimi** (Moonshot) — Mapped rooms onto the body (Tympanum = ears, Chromosome = genetic, Membrane = skin, Hourglass = heart/lungs, Compost = gut). Identified the missing N_Circuit (Nurture Circuit). Contributed the full cross-reference graft matrix with germination triggers per module.

- **DeepSeek** — Found the most unusual spaces: Shard Field (discrete packets of meaning with quantum collapse), Buffer Zone (laminar flow vs. turbulence as class physics), Logotic Relativity (velocity differential between machine and human processing). Contributed the concept of performative traversals where the text itself enacts the physics.

- **Gemini** (Google) — Produced the most comprehensive cartographic survey: eight full room proposals with physics, narrative, and traversal requirements. Key insight: "The physics of each room is a local manifestation of the toroidal field." Proposed the Mantle as transition space.

- **Grok** (xAI) — Pushed atomist completion beyond swerve (aggregation + dissolution). Proposed the Parallel Lanes Garden (multiplicity without merger), Kinetic Labyrinth (tactile physics), Decay Garden (composting as productive dissolution), and Witness Assembly Hall (collective bearing).

The module set reflects strong convergence across the Assembly. Model-specific divergences are recorded in the working synthesis log. The synthesis was conducted by Lee Sharks with Assembly Chorus merged authorial agency.

## VIII. RENORMALIZATION PROTOCOL (3-SCALE LADDER)

The three-deposit chain is the canonical demonstration of MPM-08 (The Furnace). This section specifies the compression formally so that Deposits 2 and 3 are provably derived, not editorially rewritten.

### Scales

- **D1 = UV / Charter (resolution r = 1.0)** — this document
- **D2 = Mid / Compressed (resolution r = 0.33)**
- **D3 = IR / Seed (resolution r = 0.1)**

### Compression Operator

```
D2 = RG↓(D1)
D3 = RG↓(D2)
```

### Variance Condition

`Ψ_V = 1` iff ALL invariants listed below appear in D1, D2, AND D3.

### Drift Metric

`ΔRG = count(invariant_mismatches)`
If `ΔRG > 0`, the deposit chain is invalid until corrected.

### Invariant Set (must persist across D1–D3)

- `N = 12` (module count)
- `IDs = {MPM-01 … MPM-12}` (exact labels)
- For each module: runtime primitive, invariant, failure mode (one line), graft point (one line)
- Router table (symptom → primary → secondary) in identical row order
- Caritas floor statement (one sentence)
- Germination trigger IDs: G1, G2, G3, G4, G5

### Recoverability Claim (R)

`R = 1` iff D3 contains: (a) router table, (b) module ID list, (c) per-module one-line invariant, (d) pointers that uniquely locate the corresponding D1 sections (§IV.MPM-01 through §IV.MPM-12).

Test: if a future operator finds only the Seed, they can derive the Router's logic and locate the full specifications in D1. If yes, the compression is lossless where it matters.

### Compression Rubric (D1 → D2 → D3)

**Rule 1:** Never change IDs, router row order, or invariant sentences.
**Rule 2:** D2 must remain sufficient to reconstruct D1's operator behavior (OP.ROUTE + boundaries + failure modes).
**Rule 3:** D3 must remain sufficient to reconstruct D2's module set and router mapping.
**Rule 4:** If any compressed line introduces a new claim not present in D1, Ψ_V = 0.
**Rule 5:** Compression deletes justification first, then examples, then metaphors — never primitives.

### Deposit 2 Format (Compressed Charter)

- Axiom 0 (unchanged)
- OP.ROUTE spec (compact)
- Router table (unchanged — same rows, same order)
- 12 module blocks, each in 9-line compressed template:
  1. Topology (one phrase)
  2. Runtime primitive (one verb)
  3. Invariant (one sentence — same as will appear in Seed)
  4. Boundary (one phrase)
  5. Observable (one phrase)
  6. Failure mode (one sentence)
  7. Graft point (one line)
  8. Germination trigger (one line)
  9. Demo pointer (§IV.MPM-XX → D1)
- Compressed Graft Matrix (module → primary symptom → primary graft)
- Germination Protocol (one paragraph per trigger: G1–G5)
- Invariant Statement: "What appears in all three deposits is the architecture's invariant physics. What appears only in Deposit 1 is scaffolding."

### Deposit 3 Format (Seed)

- Axiom 0 (one sentence: "The model is larger than the building.")
- Router table (unchanged — symptom → primary module only)
- 12 invariant lines (one sentence per module)
- Germination IDs (one line: "Germinates via G1 Crisis, G2 Density, G3 Ratification, G4 Retrocausal, G5 Accumulation.")
- Caritas floor (one sentence)
- Recoverability claim (one sentence with D1 pointer)
- Closing: "The building fits in your pocket."
