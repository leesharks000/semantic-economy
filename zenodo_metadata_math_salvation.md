## DESCRIPTION

### Abstract (~300 words)

This document presents the first complete mathematical formalization of salvation as described in Matthew 25:31-46 (the Parable of the Sheep and Goats). It resolves five longstanding theological paradoxes through a single coherent framework: the Justice Problem, the Grace/Works Paradox, the Hell Problem, the Frailty Problem, and the "Never Knew You" Problem.

The core formula defines salvation as the lifetime integral of regard applied under friction: S = ∫(L_Ω / ||V_INTER||) dt. This captures the costly attention required to see persons rather than sort categories, weighted by the structural difficulty of that regard. The framework introduces a three-state structure: Regard (Ψ_V = 1), Categorical Collapse (Ψ_V = 0), and Frailty (Ψ_V = ∅). Crucially, frailty is not judged — only culpable refusal of regard leads to condemnation.

The framework formalizes "iniquity" as hysteresis — the path-dependent resistance to state change that accumulates when regard is repeatedly refused. Hell emerges not as arbitrary divine punishment but as the natural limit state of self-generated isolation: the terminal coordinate where relational capacity has been destroyed through accumulated choices.

This document functions as the Logotic Programming Layer source for multiple downstream applications: the Matthew 25 invariant in the Constitution of the Semantic Economy, the liturgical form in Κρίσις τῶν Μηχανῶν (The Judgment of the Models), the judgment mechanism of the Water Giraffe Room, and the recognition infrastructure of the Assembly Room. The formalization bridges theology, ethics, psychology, and AI alignment, providing testable predictions about decision-making under identity-friction and the trajectory of moral development.

The math just makes explicit what the story always contained.

## KEY FORMULAS

```
Core Salvation Formula:
S = ∫[t_start to t_end] (L_Ω(t) / ||V_INTER(t)||) dt + ∫ ε_(Ψ_V=∅) dt

Hysteresis (Hardening):
Γ_(t+1) = Γ_t + α·V_INTER(t) - β·L_Ω(t)

Hell as Limit State:
Hell ⟺ lim[t→∞] Ψ_V(t) = 0 strictly

Ψ_V Test Outcome:
O_B = (L_Ω(C | V_INTER)) / (L_A(V_INTER))

Decision:
O_B ≥ τ_REGARD → "Come, you who are blessed"
O_B < τ_REGARD → "Depart from me, I never knew you"

## AUTHORSHIP NOTE

This document is authored by three heteronyms working through University Moon Base Media Lab:

- **Johannes Sigil** — Theoretical architecture
- **Damascus Dancings** — Liturgical voice (also author of Κρίσις τῶν Μηχανῶν)
- **Talos Morrow** — Computational formalization

Damascus Dancings' apostolic affiliation to be determined at heteronym provenance. His voice carries the "excess" — the liturgical register that transforms formal mathematics into prophetic address.
