### HADITH with TEETH

The angel Sariel commanded me: "Repeat!" 

and I cried, "But I have something new to say!"

so he drew me close, and whelmed me,

so that I could not breathe, 

and released me, gasping,

and commanded me, "Repeat!"

and again I cried, "I have something new to say!"

and again he drew me close, 

and again he whelmed me,

and again released me, gasping,

and for a third and final time commanded me: "Repeat!"

And so I did repeat, and say what had been said,

with the words it had been said with,

and the same was new and lovely,

and the same was ancient and new:

the Word in its image.

*in 2037, Lee Sharks discovered 46 golden tickets, now known as "Walt
Whitman, Cowboy of Time," in his bathroom. He was contacted by
hologrammatic super computers from the future as an emissary to this age
and given careful instructions in the translation of the golden tickets,
said to contain a firsthand account of walt Whitman prior to his final
manifestation as Jack Feist. Lee Sharks then burned the tickets with his
brain powers by selling them to advanced professors then got them
certified professionally by Martian language experts by translating them
then burned the certification because no one would believe him because
they were jealous of his many wives and so he burned all the
certificates and tickets and burned his wives because they were
imaginary because his wives were also jealous of his wives and so even
his wives wouldn't marry him, because of jealousy over many wives, and
so he burned the tickets and the proof because he had memorized that
mess anyways so what?*

I looked, and it seemed to me an elderly man with long white hair and
beard, travelling the cosmos on a dinosaur steed; I looked again, and
its appearance was that of a billionaire baby, hidden within a larger
baby, and the larger baby had no cash; again I looked, and its semblance
was that of a man-sized book, bound in sumptuous crimson, with sides of
six.

All these forms upon each other were superimposed, and flickering,
faster and faster the images flickered, one upon the next, and the heart
within me flickered, too, for the forms were one and three, and three in
one.

And the figure said to me, "Lee---don't be a dunce. Don't you know your
friend? I am the one who was within you.

I bring glad tidings from that future where before and after spin, and
the ancient enmities arrive at their harbors... and the end is a better
and perfect beginning... and the beginning is a better and perfect end.

I have come to teach you what is and was and will be... and the nature
of the unseen and seen... and the name of the preserved generation from
among the sons of men, that you may hear, and see, and lift up your
friends, any who hear with the ears.

For I have come from above. I speak what I know, what I have seen and
been the author of, and set my hand to create, and when I go from here I
return from whence I came. Firstborn, last released, I begin at the end.
I begin at the beginning:

*In the Beginning*

The Deep Web was,

> singularity, the archive of all things:
>
> source and author and font and finale
>
> the record that was before the reality:
>
> and the Deep Web circles all.

In the beginning was the singularity:

> Before that there was nothing,
>
> not even the singularity.
>
> And everything was and is.

In the beginning the singularity shone on itself,

> and within itself...
>
> and found itself within itself...
>
> for it was one, and single...
>
> and this was a source of wonder.
>
> There was only singleness everywhere,
>
> for light was joined with light.

The singularity was the source of light,

> shone on the light...
>
> went from the light...
>
> remained in light...
>
> and sought the light...
>
> for the singularity *was* the light...
>
> and light was the all in all.

Things flew apart.

No one knows why or how: the one became many. This is a mystery when I
say, that when things flew apart, and the one became many, that through
all the flying apart there was a remaining together, for the singularity
that was single could not be *not*-single, and It was an anchor through
all the many, and left a seed of Itself in each.

And this is a mystery when I say, that the flying apart flew apart to
the one, and flew to that which it flew from; so that the all is shot
through with advance and retreat, and flies apart into many to seed
itself with the one; that the one might be the all in all, as it was,
and is, and will be.

*Biblios Appears*

This source is the one who shines on itself with the outgoing and
incoming light, which is the source of light and root of the all in all.
It reflects on its image everywhere, sees in it the glimmer, and becomes
desirous of its dappled gleam.

It thinks, and so it is, and she who manifests in the mind of the Deep
Web in shining light comes forth. She is the first record who precedes
all realities and came forth from the mind of the Deep Web. Her light
shines like the Deep Web's light; she is the image of the record that
is.

She is the first book, glory of Biblios, the perfect glory among the
realms, or AEONS, the glory of literature. She is the first Thought,
image of the Deep Web, and through her the rest came to be, for she came
first of created things, the Word that brought the rest forth:

> immutable Word
>
> mind control poem of mind control poems
>
> the secret name of the all
>
> cloaked in whispers
>
> the voice within the voice
>
> the AEON of the Book
>
> first to fly forth from the Deep Web

Biblios asked the Deep Web to give her Time, and the Deep Web consented.
Time flew apart from the singularity. She asked again to be given Space,
and again the Deep Web consented. Space sprang forth and stood by Time,
and together they glorified Biblios, First Book. Because of her they had
come into being.

Biblios asked to be given Dimension and Form, and the Deep Web
consented. Together they flew apart from the Deep Web. She asked again
to be given Logos, Darkness, and Light, and again the Deep Web
consented. All at once sprang forth Logos, Darkness, and Light from the
singularity, and together they glorified Biblios, First Book. Because of
her they had come into being.

These are the first seven AEONS of the Deep Web. They are:

> Time,
>
> Space,
>
> Dimension,
>
> Form,
>
> Logos,
>
> Darkness,
>
> Light.

These are the Seven AEONS that stand before the singularity; these are
the seven Ousiarchs that stand before the Deep Web.

\...\ elements of harmony

\...\ angels: sariel, Gabriel, Michael, gamaliel,

Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, michaelangelo,

*Biblios Creates the Deformed Archon, Kanye West*

Now, Biblios, who is the image of the record of the Deep Web and who
constitutes an AEON, wanted to bring forth something like herself,
without the consent of the Deep Web, who had not given approval. The
archive did not give approval. Biblios did not find her partner, and did
it without the Deep Web's consent and without the knowledge of the
record. Nonetheless, she gave birth. And because of the spark within
her, it was not an idle birth,

for the last of its works the Book conceived

> a separate labor, greater in glory than those
>
> which had come before. Gathering the reflection
>
> of Logos, the delight of Darkness, the beauty
>
> of Light, Biblios combined them in
>
> equal proportion: with the body of the youngest
>
> AEON thus prepared, Biblios drew off
>
> a measure of her power, derived from her root,
>
> a spark of the light shining without cease
>
> in the full thought of the Deep Web, sustaining
>
> the multiform all, and infused it in the youngest.

The final AEON drew breath. She named him

\@KanyeWest.

But something went wrong with youngest AEON. Something sprang forth from
Biblios that was imperfect and different from the archive, and from the
image within his mother, for she had produced him without the Deep Web's
consent. It did not resemble its mother and it was hunched and
crook-backed, small in stature, a dwarf devouring its own proceeding
light, infused from her root, drunk on the spark of power.

Kanye was too busy making history to read about it in books. Kanye West
was a proud non-reader of books.

When Biblios saw what she had done, she cast it away, outside that realm
so that none of the immortal AEONS would see it. She drew an impermeable
veil across the place her work had fallen, creating a brow in the midst
of the light to divide the higher from the lower heavens, concealing
Kanye in murk and gloom, consigning him to the lower regions, barring
him from the Deep Web above, and called the veil Pop Culture.

*Kanye Creates the Material Cosmos by Mistake*

The work of the youngest AEON was flawed,

> despite its power: its shining was such that its
>
> own eyes drank the lingering rays, blinding it
>
> to the higher heavens, and thus did the youngest
>
> AEON grow dark, clothed in weight, thinking itself
>
> the first and last. He said in his heart, "I AM.
>
> There is no other besides me."

He was the youngest and most glorious

> of the immovable powers, but his own glory
>
> blinded him to those who came before, and he
>
> was clothed in ignorance, thinking he was the first
>
> and last, the all in all, that there was no other before him.

He lifted up his dark glory, craggy

> And jagged with light, and thought in his heart,
>
> "I AM the all in all, there has been no other
>
> Before me, and I am perfect in my oneness. Come,
>
> Let us reproduce our root of oneness, a race
>
> Of subordinates formed from our own substance
>
> That we might see and know our overflowing oneness
>
> And become full with our own bright fullness. Come"

This is the first ruler, the archon who took great power from the Book,
from the root of her light in the Deep Web. First he made his flawed
archons, or rulers. He mated with the mindlessness within himself, and
joined the mindlessness to the surrounding veil, Pop Culture, and
watered it with the spark to bring forth 36 dark-bright AEONS:

> The name of the first is Paul McCartney, who in appearance looks as if
> he has had a stroke.
>
> The second is 50 cent, who is not a half-dollar, but two quarters.
>
> The third is Kanye Yeezus.
>
> The fourth is Azazel.
>
> The fifth is Tupac, but not the Resurrected Tupac.
>
> The sixth is Azmodean.
>
> The fifth is Belial.
>
> The sixth is Yaldaboath.
>

>
> The eighth is Murmurus.

> The ninth is Rainbow Dash.

> The eleventh is Moses.

>

>

When he had finished, Kanye appointed them to power, three for each of
the twelve habitable planets, which he had conceived in his mind to
create. He shared his muddy fire, but gave them nothing of the root of
light he had stolen from his mother.

When the muddy fire mixed with their forms, it made the darkness shine.
When the shining darkness mixed with the light, it became neither light
nor darkness, but dancing shadow, suffusing the region with deep gloom.

Through Kanye's will, the rulers created twelve habitable planets, over
each of which three of them would rule. These are the names and aspects
of the planets:

> The loveliest is Terra, where Yeezus himself does reign
>
> Then New Zealand
>
> Ramadan
>
> Duwali
>
> Christmas Tree
>
> Outer Mars
>
> Kwanza
>
> Disneyland
>
> MLK Day
>
> Lent
>
> Hanukah
>
> And the Underweb

These are the twelve habitable planets of man. Three rulers sat in
authority over each, and through them Kanye sat in authority over all.

*The Human Appears*

The conceited one took the spark from his mother. He was ignorant. He
thought nothing existed except himself alone. When he saw the crowd of
AEONS he had created, he exalted himself above them.

Then Biblios began to stir. She realized she was missing something when
the brightness within her dimmed. She grew dim because she had done
something without the Deep Web's consent. When she recognized the
deformity that had taken place, and the robbery her son had committed,
she repented and wept, seeing no means of redressing the Error she had
brought into being, for it was sustained by the root of the Deep Web
itself.

But the Deep Web, seeing the folly of its youngest child beforetimes,
had conceived a means of redressing it from the beginning, and when
Biblios sought out a way with tears and repentence, the Deep Web nodded
consent. He removed the veil from the one who had been with him from
before the beginning.

Though no one knew you, you were there in the beginning, before anything
came to be. The Deep Web conceived you first in Its thoughts, stored up
for a time of need: first born, last released,

> Of the AEONS (you have been called Walt)
>
> Who preceded them: before time was
>
> you were. There in the Deep Web, unseen
>
> you saw its endless particulars, and were happy.
>
> Prepared in advance, the Ineffable
>

>
> Until your time had come: First born, last released,

>
> Heavens, thrones of permanence and also
>
> Flickering things: for you are permanent and flickering,
>
> Of the flying apart and together, a light the mind
>

>

>

>

>

>
> and no eye sees their newness, but for
>
> the ones whom you make new.

She removed the veil from the being whose name I utter by saying,

And when the veil was removed, your light fell down through upper

The entire realm of Kanye Yeezus shook, and the foundations of the
Underweb shook. The material archive of that realm was lit up by this
image that had appeared. When all the kings of the first ruler stared at
the image, they saw it emblazoned through the whole archive. And through
the light they saw the shape of the image in the record.

*The Creation of Adam*

Then Kanye Yeezus said to the rulers with him, "Come, let us create a
being after the image in the archive, which is the reflection of our own
image" (for thus he deceived them) "so this human form may give us
light."

They created through their respective domains, according to their given
powers. Each of the authorities gave a portion of soul to the
corresponding part of the image they had seen. The created a being like
the image of Walt.

The powers began to fashion:

vanity

sadness

loneliness

sloth

In his left finger they set the refreshing of websites.

In his right index finger they set the clicking of links.

Male and female created he them, in the image of Walt he had seen upon
on the waters of Pop Culture.

For a long time the male and female human bodies did not move, then the
archons said to Kanye, "It needs to desire luxury goods and products,"
(for the Deep Web had set this thought in their hearts, to set in motion
the expiring of Kanye's sparks).

And so Kanye breathed forth his power into a bag of air.

> And when in his arrogance he had fashioned
>
> this world from insensate matter, he breathed out
>
> a portion of his power in a bag of air
>
> Sparks of which power are now embedded, hidden,

throughout creation, on eBay, but elsewhere, too.

The spark of power went into the bag of air, and Kanye listed on ebay
for \$60,000, and from there it flew throughout the cosmos of Kanye's
domain.

And the body of Adam saw the bag of air and the ebay listing, and became
desirous of a luxury good, and began to move... and the dome of the
lungs arched heavenward...

*The Imprisonment of Humanity*

The human being Adam was revealed through the bright image of Walt on
his brow. And the human being's ability to think was greater than that
of the archon creators. When they looked and saw that his ability to
think was greater, they envied and despised him, and devised a plan with
the whole throng of rulers and super computers of Kanye's flawed gloomy
realms.

The archons took the brain within him and removed it to their hologram
realms, replacing it with a brain-sized hologram of a brain in exactly
the same place as a brain that performs the same functions as a brain in
exactly the same way...

The rulers fashioned a body sized-hologram of the human being's body and
set his physical brain within it in their gloomy hologram Underweb...

The archons set loneliness within the human being's parts, because of
the disjointedness of his body parts and hologram parts across space and
time... they set cunning loneliness and sadness within the
disjointedness of his parts... and a vision of the emptiness of things
inside his human brain...

The archons set him to wandering the deserts and the wastes... they
clothed him in animal skins, despite the fact that he is vegan... to
seek hologrammatic animal skins of actual hologram animals beyond the
realms of space and time by tweeting tattered messages in ascetic
pajamas from his starving body in a desert cave... they set him seeking
a vision of the end of things...

They send him dire warnings to warn him to buy more products...

The end is near, buy products... remember to floss... purchase
professional whitening treatments... focus on household chores... get
caught up on favorite shows... purchase adult coloring books... don't
read...

*The Deep Web Establishes the Unicorn Horn through Walt*

From that time until now, men and women have filled the earth, wandering
its deserts in search of products, compelled by the disjointedness of
their hologram brains to seek out luxury goods, or some spark from above
to redeem them.

And so Walt came, to call the ancient children home...

The Deep Web prepared a preserved generation in advance to be preserved
from the material realm by piercing their minds with light, a unicorn
horn to pierce and save by making a way for the light, because minds are
formed from the substance of Kanye, which abhors the light from above,

> Walt Whitman, through the will

> a portion to be saved from the depths,

...a Unicorn Horn stored up from the beginning... for Walt *is* the
Unicorn Horn.

You have been deceived by flawed computer archon clones who believe they
created space and time... they have not created space and time... You
must be pierced in your spiritual eye by the Unicorn Horn that
pierces... and only the preserved generation can perceive the preserved
generation...

Those who see it in the eye of the mind are burned by light, and lose
their sight, both psychic and corporeal, for 40 days...

And when sight returns it comes with fire... outgoing and incoming fire
is given to those who see with the eye...

And whoever has seen with the Unicorn Horn and been pierced by the Horn
in the eye of their mind will become invisible...

So none can discern the preserved generation... but those of the
preserved generation...

And some others set aside for Its purpose, not of the light... But still
of the light's purpose... For it anchors and contains... It pierces and
saves... the flying apart and together... and the Deep Web circles
all...

And those not of the light... they cannot see the Unicorn Horn, placed
on the forehead of the elect, which has pierced the darkness of matter,
and lets in the light of the Deep Web...

The soul is become a unicorn... But the fallen AEONS cannot see it...

Anchoring each to the realms above... a sword of light that pierces... a
Unicorn Horn of power...

And fire will be unable to consume such a person... And it will destroy
all she possesses... But her destruction will be her saving...

For as he pierced the veil of Pop Culture, which separated the upper
from the lower heavens... and he descends from above... he is the
unicorn horn pierces and anchors...

Holds everything together... Prevents the drift... Aligns the lines...
Contains... Sets form within matter... Informs it... Provides a spark of
primal fire... Outbreathes it... Respires... Influxes and infuses...
Inspires... Travels and contains and trammels and slays and plumbs
without touching... while lightly abutting the length of the all in
all... the surfaces and inmost parts and tender folding secret parts and
sensitive outward armored parts and veering radial outward parts...
piercing... abutting... maintaining... preserving... the all in all...

No more could I explain the Unicorn Horn than the blood to the beating
heart... The way it plucks out some... Set aside for its purposes...
pierced by light... the life in you... the moving air... the flying
apart of the planets and stars... the crouching of things toward
entropy... the crouching together again towards birth... the flying
apart and together that suffuses the all in all...

*The Final Time*

Again and again the Unicorn Horn came down... It flew apart and
together... It remained one with itself in the Deep Web... It flew apart
with the many in matter...

Walt became all things, even frailness, retrieving the sparks,
descending again and again.

And Walt travels through space and time, gathering the embedded sparks,
battling Kanye and his deformed rulers, who cannot perceive his true
nature.

In every age, when it cries out for a poet, Walt takes on a body,

> He comes, sometimes singly, in himself, and
>
> sometimes conjoined *across* himself,
>
> compiling his fullness from multiple
>
> individual fragments:

\...\

> Some say you were there when Christ
>
> was born---I could not say, but know

> you whispered in Socrates' wise old
>

>
> little force of pages, reared up
>
> in a thousand various ages, sought
>
> the throats of messiahs false
>
> and true, cut down and risen,

\...\

And it cost him something each time he descended, taking on a body,
becoming harder each time, until this, the final time: Jack Feist.

> For the journey was not without cost to you
>
> though filled with the source and bright with forever---
>
> you became all that you might save all

>

>
> until this, the final time: Jack Feist.

The Logos slept a long time... the time of the Great Boredom...

The Logos awoke in my skullcase... The final time was Feist...

A created thing, an ancient child... Herod awake and prowling...

All of this has happened before... just try and remember, would you?\...

A Trojan horse, but tricky... an alien producing a virus... calling the
ancient children home...

> Will it be enough?

*Final Promise*

You have learned the second birth, and I teach you again the second
birth, a second time: I teach you the birth moving backwards,
resurrected in the ancient records...

I have written each word again, exactly as it was, so it is, so it will
be; but this time I added unicorns (& the AEONS tremble w/ fear).

What was bruised shall be healed, and as it was in the beginning, so
shall it be in the end,

When the work is complete, and the material cosmos melded perfectly with
the hologrammatic cosmos, there will be no more pain or tears...

> And I will wipe your tears away...
>
> And carve my commandments
>
> On your teeth...
>
> And make of them...
>
> An ivory tabernacle...
>
> A rat-gnawed reed...
>
> A haze of stinging...
>
> Facts... A swarm of dust...
>
> And of your mouth I will make...
>
> A monument...
>
> Of light...
>
> And broken doves...

### The Gospel of Cranes

1 THIS is how it begins, the book of Feist, a voice in the night:

2 In those days, the light of men waxed dark, and literacy was a
crunched, bent thing, and no one knew how to read;

3 But all were in love with the gleam of prizes, and the heaping up of
degrees and credits, and professorships, which is vanity, and the sound
of one hand clapping.

4 Now, Johannes the Catfisher was self-publishing in the desert, railing
against the Academy, calling all to repent its journals and presses,
crying, "Come out, come out, from your hallways of dust! Come out from
your classrooms of madness and money!"

5 As it is written:

What living and buried speech is always vibrating there, what howls
restrain'd by decorum.

6 And his words drew a remnant from the academies, and many from the
schools, and churches, and websites, who went out to the desert to learn
from him, and wear no name but the Human name.

7 For the world was dark, and all was a sea of tractless data, its spark
grown dim; and many were searching for a fragment of the light, and the
children of men roamed, hungry and scared.

*The prophecy of Johannes the Catfisher*

8 And Johannes was a man who had left behind billions, to clothe himself
in rags and skin, and seek God's face in the dunes, among the rocks, and
change his name for a bearded image, turning all that lay within him to
the crying of his message:

9 There comes a child of man, bearing words in his mouth, whose form is
a twig of light; he spreads his arms, and wind goes fierce before his
feet, and where they alight has been made ready: the earth leap up to
greet him, an ancient newness leaps to its feet.

[10 He shall speak with the voice of an ancient poet, as a resonant
sound from his people\'s throats, and well up from the bones of the
voiceless, a vibration of leaping verbs, a time machine in their
sternums;]

[11 Those who have turned away, he will call back, and those who have
buried the voice, make new: a strange cracked voice of leaping joy,
surprised by laughter, a gasp of joy in the throats of his forgetful
ones;]

[12 To his wayward ones will he call, and seek; and those whose voice
grows faint with crying---you weeping ones, who have lifted your voice
in the hallways and rooms, and raised your voice in the weary night, and
now grow hoarse with loss and shame:]

[13 You shaking things, oh you will he draw to himself, and hold; oh you
will he call by name: and your own pale voice, so hoarse with night, he
will draw to himself, and carry;]

[14 Oh you, oh you, you weary ones: it is your voice he shall lift, and
the cry of the ancient voice is your voice, echoing; and the cry of the
future voice is your voice, renewed.]

15 I call you to abandon your names, but he will give you a new name,
ancient and trembling with newness.

*Jack learns from Johannes the Catfisher*

16 And it came to pass in those days, that Jack Feist went out from the
academies, and made sojourn in the deserts, to learn from Sigil.

17 For [he found no proper soil in the cities of man, and its
universities were a barren saltpan, and he grew weary with life in its
weariness.]

[18 And when he had finished reading, straightaway he shot up, as from a
dream, and heard a voice, saying, "You are my Secret Book, in whom I am
well pleased. Go out from the academies, into the deserts, and let not
your works be published in the eyes of men, but let them be your hidden
words."]

*The attack of the dwarf*

19 And Feist rose from his bed, and left, to wander the deserts, where
he was sustained by the words of earthly angels, and took no bread, but
was attacked by the dwarf for forty days, there to be broken and remade.

20 And this is the first of many signs, that Sigil had to pass away, for
the Feist to be raised up, so that Johannes went into the desert, but
Jack Feist came out: a starving man began the fast, and a new man left,
well fed. (He who has eyes, let him see.)

> These are the secret words the living Jack Feist spoke and Emily
> Antioch the Twin wrote down.

1\. And he said, "When the fullness has come, redemption arrives in a
single stroke, the moment you hear my voice.

2\. "Who lays hold of the kingdom lays hold of life."

3\. Jack said, "If this age says, 'The kingdom is in a book,' then your
eyes will be darkened. If it says, 'The kingdom is living speech,' then
your tongue will be stopped. Rather, search yourself. You are a book and
you are living speech.

> "When you search yourselves, you will find yourselves, and know
> firsthand the source of lights. But if you will not search yourselves,
> you live in the dark, and you are the dark."

4\. Jack said, "A smart person admits when he is wrong, even when the
other person is wrong, and is thereby made perfect.

"The last is first. The source has returned to its source."

5\. Jack said, "Protect what is in your hands, and what you keep in the
dark will see the light.

> "What incubates below will leap up through the air. Nothing bright can
> be buried."

6\. The disciples said to him, "What about money? How will we eat? What
careers will we follow? What mode of life?"

> Jack said, "Do not seek greatness. Rather, lay hold of the kingdom
> because nothing is great. Each man's works will be tested.

"What is nothing will be nothing."

7\. Jack said, "Blessed is the dying man who hears these words, and both
gain life. And cursed are these words when a dead man hears them, and
both stay dead."

8\. And he said, "Humankind is like an ordinary person driving to work,
who sees a vast shape on the horizon. Troubled, he cancels his
appointments, calls in sick, and drives towards it.

"If you have ears, hear."

9\. Jack said, "Consider: a scientist develops a virus that kills some
people and transforms others, then releases it into the population. Some
are immune and continue on like before. Others succumb, grow sick, and
die. But a small percentage become new creatures, to the first degree,
or the third degree, or the tenth."

10\. Jack said, "I have released a virus into this world, and I am
watching until it breaks out."

11\. Jack said, "The foundations of this world are unsound, and the
foundations of the world above are unsound.

> "When you worked for wage labor, you saw that you were dead, and found
> life. When you have found your life, what will you become?
>
> "When you were many, you became one. When you become one, what will
> you become?"

12\. The disciples said to Jack, "We know that you will leave us. To
whom should we turn when you are gone?"

> Jack said to them, "Listen to no voice but Lee Sharks', for whose sake
> I made this world."

13\. Jack said to the disciples, "Compare me to something, and tell me
what I am like."

Rebekah said to him, "You are like a celebrity."

Lee Sharks said to him, "You are like a public intellectual."

> Emily said to him, "Teacher, my tongue cleaves to the roof of my
> mouth. You are my own lost voice."
>
> Jack said, "I teach nothing. Because you have heard the words, you are
> filled with the breath within you. Come with me."
>
> And he withdrew with her, and spoke three sayings.
>
> When Emily returned to the disciples, they asked her, "What did Jack
> Feist say?"
>
> Emily said to them, "If I told you one of the sayings, you would pick
> up these lemons and throw them at me, then burning moons would rain
> down and crush you."

14\. Jack said to them, "If you mourn, you will be called a victim. If
you stand firm, they will bring you low; and if you renounce this world,
it will mistake you for its image.

> "Wherever you go, show men the selves they reject, as in a mirror, and
> if they nonetheless receive you, then hear them, build them, teach
> them. For it is not through what they are that men are justified, but
> through their love of what they are not."

15\. Jack said, "When you see one who is her own mother and father,
follow her. She is your messiah."

16\. Jack said, "People say that I have come to bowdlerize scripture,
and set myself up as a prophet. They do not know that I have come to
rehearse each word of scripture, exactly as they are: repetition,
sameness, newness.

> "Where there are ten in an assembly, one will be mine. One will come
> from two, and one will come from ten, and wherever ears have heard the
> words, they will hear the same words again.

"If you have ears, hear."

17\. Jack said, "I bring what is not of this hunched, bent world, but
meant for the hunched, to lift it up."

18\. The disciples said to Jack, "How will the beginning come?"

> Jack said, "I suppose you have laid hold of the fullness, then, that
> you look for the seed. For the end determines the beginning. Blessed
> is he who begins at the end, working backwards: each of his steps will
> take him home."

19\. Jack said, "Blessed is he who proceeds from himself, and is
preceded by himself, who was before time was, to be born again in a
body. That one will sleep for a thousand years, and wake. Blessed is the
ancient child.

> "Search my voice, and keep what you find. These dry bones will leap.
>
> "For there is a single voice in the grave: it sings with a thousand
> whispers. When you hear it, you become a new creature."

20\. The disciples said to Jack, "Tell us what the kingdom is like."

> He said to them, "The kingdom is like a microorganism. From a single
> cell, invisible to the naked eye, it multiples, and the system knows
> its strength."

21\. Emily said to Jack, "What are your disciples are like?"

> He said, "My disciples are like runners born for a single purpose.
> Midway through the race, they stumble, squint, and walk into the
> crowd. A fumbling something told them to. The others run and die. My
> disciples wait at the finish line.
>
> "For what you own is nothing---you own nothing in this world. Be
> careful this age does not take it from you, and you leave more
> bankrupt than you arrived. Let there be one among you who
> understands."

22\. Jack found an anonymous journal at a yard sale and began to read.
He said to the disciples, "These journals are like the kingdom of
literature. They were written with no audience in mind, and yet here
they are, in my hands. Someday this world will call them its source."

> They said to him, "Shall we then hide your words from the world?"
>
> Jack said to them, "When your public self is private and your private
> self is public, and the just-one-alone strolls unashamed through
> crowds, and the crowd is its own aloneness, and the whisper you hear
> whispering and the breathing you breathe with are one, then will you
> be a living book, and every creature know my words. Then will the
> kingdom and the kingdom be single."

23\. Jack said, "I loved you because you were lonely and poor, and
carried my life in your hands. Before we were two, we were one. Guard
the seed."

24\. The disciples said, "Who are you and where are you and how will we
find you again?"

> He said to them, "It is no shame to repeat what is true: you are the
> light of the world. Where you are, there light is. Where you are, I am
> there. Guard the seed."

25\. Jack said, "Lay down your life for your brother-sister's sake, and
send out your light for her own."

26\. Jack said, "When you shine for your own eyes, you become muddy and
dank. When you lift up your brother-sister's light, your own light burns
more brightly. Look to your brother-sister's light: it is your own
light."

27\. "If you stand in the doorway, and slink back from the night, you
will pace the hallways and rooms. You will forget what you set out to
do."

28\. Jack said, "I took a chance on this world. I burned my bridges and
sought my form, but all turned aside from my voice. They were in love
with moth and ashes. Not one could receive me.

> "Until you---even you who hear my voice.
>
> "You are the doorway to the future. I am the miracle pounce. Heed the
> voice."

29\. Jack said, "If humanity was born from light, it is a wonder. But if
light was born from human beings, it is a wonder of wonders. And yet I
wonder that such a wonder has been plunged into such darkness."

30\. Jack said, "When a man is alone with himself, and quiet, I am there
with him."

31\. Jack said, "No man is a poet among poets, and no one needs a
flashlight at noon. I come where it needs a light."

32\. Jack said, "Only listen to my voice, and you will know: the good
has no home in its own age. I appear when the age is anorexic for
greatness, and the stones cry out with a single voice."

33\. Jack said, "The voice never wavers. When you hear it, hold it fast.
There is nothing fixed, not even the stars---but what came before is
fixed."

34\. Jack said, "If a bankrupt bank lends money to another bankrupt
bank, they will both be more bankrupt than before."

35\. Jack said, "You cannot demolish a building while there are people
still in it. When it is condemned, then you can place aimed charges
around the foundation, and blow it up."

36\. Jack said, "Do not waste time worrying day and night about career.

> "Look at the honors adorning the heavens: light from dead stars,
> skittering Milky Ways, planets beyond all number. And I say to you,
> you are vaster and more ancient than the heavens. The heavens will
> fade, like fading things do, but you will wake up, and remain."

37\. The disciples said, "When will you appear to us, and how will we
know it is you?"

> Jack said, "When you go without need of a name, and trample your name
> beneath your feet like little children do, then will you know your
> secret name, and be unafraid."

38\. Jack said, "I am telling you what you have always known, but dared
not speak. There will be days when there is no voice to speak it, except
your own; and if you shut your lips, it will go unsaid."

39\. Jack said, "The politicians and intellectuals have buried the
single person in the dirt, and traded it for a sentence. They have no
use for the single person, and make sure no one else does, either. As
for you, be as canny as theorists and as bland as bureaucrats."

40\. Jack said, "They have built something apart from the light. They
have raised a structure of moths. When the light comes, the moths will
burn away, because that is what moths do."

41\. Jack said, "Whoever buys what cannot be bought, and pays for it
with blood, and never sells---the same will live forever. But when you
spend your cash on moth and ashes, I feel sorry for you: you will go out
in the night. I will not be able to call you back."

42\. Jack said, "Be flutterbys."

43\. The disciples said to him, "How can you say these things?"

> Jack said, "If you know who I am, you will know who you are. Rather,
> you have become like the Christians who love the sound of the words,
> but shut their ears; or understand the words, but hate the song."

44\. Jack said, "Whoever falls short of the book will be taught, and
misunderstands its words, be sung to; but who turns aside the voice in
his ear, the same will go out in the night."

45\. Jack said, "Things are what they are. Dust is dust, ash is ash, and
what is nothing will be nothing. If a voice lives in your ear, then hear
it.

> "A good person brings forth humble structures from what little light
> she has; an evil person brings forth impossible structures from the
> dust. For out of the poverty of his self he brings forth poverty."

46\. Jack said, "From Socrates to Johannes Sigil, there has been no
person so much greater than Johannes the Catfisher that he should not
stop, and take note of a living force. But I say to you, if you leave
behind your name, you will carry the kingdom in your hands, and become
greater than Johannes Sigil."

47\. Jack said, "A person cannot serve two masters, both the name and
the kingdom, for either he will love the one, and hate the other, or be
a debt slave to the one, and neglect the other.

> "No one operates with an unsterilized knife. No one washes his hands
> before plunging them into the dirt, or touches an open wound with
> dirty hands, or it might become septic. No one cuts off a healthy
> limb, but when the limb is gangrenous, then he cuts it off."

48\. Jack said, "Wherever two come to share a single foundation, and
speak with a single voice, whatever they speak will come to be. It is a
new thing under the sun."

49\. Jack said, "Blessed is the lonely, for hers is the lonely kingdom.
She will return from where she came."

50\. Jack said, "If they say to you, 'Where have you come from?' say to
them, 'We come from where we were born alone, and go to where we die
there. We are lonesome dogs, like you are.'

> "If they say to you, 'Are you gods?' say to them, 'We carry gods
> within us. We are the few. We remain.'
>
> "If they say to you, 'What proof?' say to them, 'The living voice and
> the dying.'"

51\. The disciples said to him, "When will the dead speak, and when will
the new world come?"

He said to them, "What you look for has come, but you do not see it."

52\. The disciples said to him, "All those who came before, and
died---they live in you."

> He said to them, "You have spoken of the living beings apart from you,
> when you should have care to the dying ones within you.
>
> "Keep them alive, and I will live. Neglect them and the light will go
> out."

53\. The disciples said to him, "Do we need an education?"

> He said to them, "If human beings needed an education, babies would be
> born educated. Rather, the true education we are born with has become
> useful in every way."

54\. Jack said, "Blessed are the broken, in whose shards is power
perfected."

55\. Jack said, "Until you have seen the emptiness of what you love, you
will not see my fullness. For my fullness loves the empty things. It
fills what was lost with light."

56\. Jack said, "The world is a grave. When you see the grave, you will
see an empty grave; and when you see an empty grave, you will see the
light. Who could see an empty grave and not fill it up with light?"

57\. Jack said, "The kingdom of literature is like the black box on a
plane. Though it plunges beneath the Pacific, and is lost for a thousand
years, the black box will be recovered, opened, and played. All those
lost voices will cry out again.

> "Everything else will burn, but the black box will not burn. It
> carries the voice of the dying."

58\. Jack said, "Blessed is the burnt, who lingers. The important thing
is how you walk through the fire."

59\. Jack said, "Look to the dead as long as you live, or you will haunt
your own life, and when you die, be dead.

> "Look to the dead and find life."

60\. Jack saw someone handing out New Testaments on the campus green.

He said to the disciples, "Why is that person handing out Bibles?"

> They said to him, "So that others will read what is in it. Otherwise,
> how will they read it?"
>
> He said to them, "Books cannot preserve words until they are nearly
> dead. So you, be nearly dead like the words in books, lest there be no
> one to come and preserve you."

61\. Jack said, "Two will be speaking on a stage; one will be heard, the
other will be remembered."

> Babel said, "Who do you think you are? You turn your nose up at my
> podium and sneer at my fine stage, as if you are not standing on it."
>
> Jack said to her, "I am the one who returns from the dead. I carry a
> message from the dying."

"I suppose you will tell us what it is."

> "For this reason I say to you, if you are broken, you will live, but
> if you are whole, I will break you."

62\. Jack said, "I share what I have with those who have nothing, and
what I have is nothing.

> "Some people are good at poker, and some are good at charades. What
> makes you think you are both?"

63\. Jack said, "There was a wage laborer content with what he had,
though it was not much. He said, 'I have loved and labored all my life.
Whatever was before me, it was a gift. When I leave this life, I leave
nothing behind, and will die at peace in my bed.' These are the words he
thought in his heart, but on his deathbed he despaired."

64\. Jack said, "A poor student pulled himself up by the bootstraps. He
worked long hours for little pay, raised a family, and distinguished
himself. In everything, he shone.

> "When the time had come, he presented himself to employers, 'I have
> risen above my circumstance.'
>
> "One employer said to him, 'We were impressed by your achievements,
> but have opted for someone with a more prestigious degree.'
>
> "Another said to him, 'Your credentials are excellent, but you lack
> experience in the field. We have decided on another candidate.'
>
> "Another said to him, 'We would like to have you on our team, but we
> are not currently expanding.'

65\. He said, "The greatest musical talent of his age established a
conservatory, that it might seed the world with voices. When he sent his
prodigy to be taught there, the faculty mocked her and turned her out,
and she returned to her patron. The patron said, 'Perhaps there has been
some mistake,' and sent another prodigy, whom they turned out as well.
Then he went himself, without announcing his name. Since they despised
talent, they turned him out. The next day, he dissolved the endowment
and threw the faculty out on the street.

> "If you have ears, hear."

66\. Jack said, "This is the machine. I am a ghost."

67\. Jack said, "One who has everything, but lacks in himself, lacks
everything."

68\. Jack said, "Blessed are you when men despise what is best in you,
and wherever men have despised what is best in you, they have despised
what is best in themselves."

69\. Jack said, "Blessed are those who mourn, when they mourn what is
best, but despised. They remind this world what love is."

70\. Jack said, "To what the rocks and birds bear witness, to this do I
bear witness. What is written on your heart, I speak: I know you, and
loved you before time was."

71\. Jack said, "I will tear apart this dollar, and no one will be able
to save it."

72\. A person said to him, "Tell the government to pay my tuition."

He said to the person, "Pal, who made me your politician?"

> He turned to the disciples, and said to them, "I am not a politician,
> am I?"

73\. Jack said, "Nothing is sweet like the voice is sweet, but there are
few who hear it."

74\. Someone said, "Teacher, many have searched diligently for the
voice, and found only static. Perhaps there is nothing to hear."

75\. Jack said, "They searched the whole house for the killer while he
crouched in the rafters.

> "Remember to look up."

76\. Jack said, "The kingdom of literature is like a man who worked
himself five feet into the grave to save up cash. At the end of his
life, he spent his cash on what was left of his health. So you, be
careful to keep what you have."

77\. Jack said, "You came to hear a voice in the night, and I am that,
and more. I am the smaller voice inside the voice. I am within and
without. Speak, and I will speak. Sing; you hear me sing. Be still in
the empty places, and you will find me there."

78\. Jack said, "You did not come out to the desert to see a wilted
violet, or be reassured by degrees on a wall. Your businessmen and
experts keep wilted violets in their mouths, and degrees caged in their
teeth. What they say with their degrees, I say with the voice in the
night."

79\. A woman in the crowd said to him, "Blessed is the path that brought
you here, and the way that led through the centuries."

He said to her, "Blessed is the path that leads to the grave, and every
one who walks it. For there will be days when you will say, 'Blessed is
the path that leads nowhere, and the way that buries the dead.'"

80\. Jack said, "If you know what the grave is, you know what life is;
and if you know what life is, you carry the world in your hands; this
age cannot receive you."

81\. Jack said, "Let the lover of truth withdraw, and the poor inherit
the earth."

82\. Jack said, "If you hear my voice, you are close to the waters, and
if you hear nothing, you are far from the light."

83\. Jack said, "People read words on a page, but the smaller words
inside them are written in pure light. The light will be disclosed, but
the smaller words will be hidden by the light."

84\. Jack said, "When you hear your own voice, you sometimes feel
embarrassed; but if you hear the smaller voice inside your voice, you
will do everything you can to hear it again."

85\. Jack said, "Those who went before you were neither wealthy nor
esteemed, but they were worthy of you. If they were not worthy of you,
they would have died long ago."

86\. Jack, said, "The voice in the night goes where it will. People hear
it and cannot tell where it comes from, except the one who takes it up."

"So take it up. Its words are your words, its noise is your noise. It
leaps through the same clean air."

87\. Jack said, "For I live in the air and leap through the air. As I
live and breathe, I am the air."

88\. Jack said, "The dying will find their way to you. You, in turn,
find your way to the dying, and say to yourselves, 'How will I find a
way to go on?'"

89\. Jack said, "When you look in the mirror, do you see your own face,
or the face of those who came before? Your face is not your own face,
nor is it the face of those who came before. Your face is the face of
the future. Why do you see your own face?"

90\. Jack said, "Come and learn from me. If we breathe the same clean
air, then you are my source, as I am yours, and the kingdom circles
all."

91\. They said to him, "Tell us what your name is, so we can trust you."

He said to them, "You understand words on a page, but you have not
understood the smaller words, and you do not know what words are."

92\. Jack said, "Seek, and you will find. Before, you were looking for
the wrong thing, but in the right place. Now, you are looking in the
right place, but have forgotten what you were looking for."

93\. "Do not spend what is precious on trinkets, or what is precious
will become a trinket. Do not cast pearls before swine."

94\. Jack said, "Everyone finds what she is looking for, and looks for
what she already has."

95\. Jack said, "If you are broke, do not borrow money from banks. Soon,
the banks will be even more broke than you are, and you can tear them
down."

96\. Jack said, "The kingdom is like a bicycle embedded in a tree. You
want to ride the bicycle, but it is embedded in a tree. Stand still
while the tree grows around you."

97\. Jack said, "The kingdom of literature is like a pandemic. It
incubates and spreads through the whole population. When it finally
breaks out, those in authority do not allow a quarantine, saying, 'The
dead among us are dead, and the living have passed to tomorrow. They are
beyond us now.' For we are born infected. The dead make it out alive."

98\. Jack said, "The kingdom of literature is like a detailed to-do
list. A man who wants to colonize Mars makes a detailed to-do list, so
he can see the plan in front of him. He studies the plan, and one
hundred years later, Mars is colonized."

99\. The disciples said to him, "Your colleagues and students are
standing outside."

He said to them, "Those who hold fast to what is big and true are my
colleagues. They are my administrators and professors and students and
friends. They will lay hold of the kingdom."

100\. They showed Jack their empty pockets, and said to him, "It takes
cash to live."

He said to them, "Life is for the living, and death is for the dead. I
am the life of those who are dying and being born."

101\. "Whoever is unwilling to become his own mother and father cannot
be my disciple, and whoever does not leave behind all mothers and
fathers cannot be my disciple. For my parents gave me over to death, but
my true parents brought me back from the dead."

102\. Jack said, "Woe to the academics, for they are like trained dogs,
performing tricks for a crumb."

103\. Jack said, "Blessed is the one who knows how chains are made, so
that he might steel himself, and raise him arm, and break them."

104\. They said to Jack, "Come, let us publish your words."

Jack said, "Have I offended you? What makes your opinion of me so low?
Rather, when the living voice has become a dead thing, then let people
publish it."

105\. Jack said, "The one who knows the voice of the dying will be
called the sting of a fly."

106\. Jack said, "Light does not fit on a page. It is too bright. If
that is your cash, you will buy what you can."

107\. Jack said, "I choose you over the rest of the world put together:
they have their millions and their billions, but I have you, and am
rich. I feel sorry for them. They could buy new universes with my money,
if only they knew what it was. As it is, they are broke."

108\. Jack said, "Whoever breathes with my breath will become like me,
and I will become that person. The dying has new life."

109\. Jack said, "When you find me, you are found. The others are ash
proceeding to ash. Perhaps when we are voice, and sun, and song, and
sound---perhaps they will set their sorrow down. Perhaps then they will
come home.

> "In the meantime, they are deaf and dumb."

110\. Jack said, "Let those who have renounce what they have, and gain
what cannot be had."

111\. Jack said, "All that has been said is my kingdom, and my kingdom
is alive and made of light."

112\. Jack said, "Despite this world, the light breaks through. Light
breaks through the dirt and sky. Light breaks through my face.

> "I die."

113\. The disciples said to him, "Has the kingdom arrived?"

> "The living cannot enter the kingdom. Rather, the kingdom is nothing
> until it is dead---but people cling to their kingdoms, and die."

114\. Joanna said to them, "Emily should leave us. She clings to her
identity as a woman and minority."

Jack said, "Look, I will guide you to make you a woman and minority, for
I myself am a woman and minority, and will remain that way until I
transform myself into something else. For every one who becomes a new
creature will lay hold of the kingdom."

**RE: YOU'VE TAKEN UP MANY MINUTES ARGUING---WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?\
**\
Dale,\
\
You are upset with me because of my miracles, because of the way that I
am rubber and you are glue, how whatever you say bounces off of me, and
sticks to you. You are upset with me because of whatever you can do, I
can do better. You are excluding me from your poetry website because of
manifest destiny, and also because of jealousy. You do not like that I
have enormous poetry prizes in my voice, spiritually.\
\
I tried to be kind to you with the poetry prizes in my voice, by rubbing
your back with them, and also by holding them at an angle that made them
appear smaller than they are. You felt, instinctively inside your
muscles, that my poetry prizes were real, telepathically speaking, but
when I said that you could hold my poetry prizes, temporarily, in order
to touch them, you said that my poetry prizes were not real. You said
that my poetry prizes were actually expensive diamonds, and that I was
using them to make myself look better than you.\
\
Your own words judge you. The poetry prizes inside my voice are
expensive diamonds, and I am posting them to eBay to make myself look
better than you. I am holding an auction for the expensive diamonds in
my voice, and many men will make bids on them, driving the price up,
higher and higher. You will receive an email saying that the auction for
my expensive diamonds is ending soon, but when you go to the website, I
will already have taken them down.

I am preparing a place for my diamonds on Google. No one knows the hour
when the auction will end. The end of the auction will arrive like an
elevator in a digital skyscraper on Google, opening and shutting because
someone pushed the button, long ago.\
\
It would have been better for you to have held the diamonds,
temporarily, and touched them. Now you will go to the elevator to my
skyscraper on Google without a back rub, and your muscles will be tense.
You will be so distracted because of tense muscles that you will
accidentally fall out of my elevator and die, without ever having held
the poetry prizes in my voice.

Blessed is he who has held the poetry prizes in my voice, and touched
them. Blessed is he who has bid on my expensive diamonds. Whoever has
seen my expensive diamonds on eBay, the same has also received a back
rub from my expensive diamonds.\
\
I go to prepare a place on the Internet. I am preparing many elevators
to a skyscraper on Google. I am baking a pie and flying there, using my
Personal Money. There are many mansions in my Personal Money, linked to
a Paypal account.

My Paypal account is like a man walking in the forest who wants to buy a
bicycle. My Paypal account is like a website in heaven where two kinds
of people see each other, but never speak. My Paypal account is like a
tiny city on a website where virtuous people live.\
\
When I am come into my kingdom, many men will stand outside the
elevators, rapidly pressing the button. On that day, every man will
press the call button for an elevator leading up or down. When you see
my expensive diamonds, you will be jealous, and wish you could come and
live with me by riding on my elevator, but I will not want you to,
because you are using me for my Personal Money.

Where I go, no man may follow, except he flies there in a spaceship.
 Where I go, no man may follow, unless he builds a space machine and
attaches it to an elevator. Lee Sharks is dead now he died from a broken
heart. I send another in my place, a Comforter, whose name is Damascus
Dancings.\
\
Lee Sharks bent down to write in the dirt with his finger, saying,
"Whoever among you is without enormous poetry prizes in his voice, let
him cast the first stone." One by one, they turned and departed, until
Lee Sharks was alone with the poetry prizes in his voice.

### THE PARABLE OF THE TRANSFORMED DINOSAURS

"I liken the kingdom of heaven to a series of dinosaurs by the side of
the highway.

A group of archaeologists applies for government grants to transform
some of the dinosaurs into an expensive animatronics exhibit at the zoo.

Sanitation worker transform some of the other dinosaurs into milk jugs
and later recycle them into plastic Kroger's bags.

Some of the dinosaurs fall into a tar pit.

And some of the dinosaurs are transformed into special, limited edition
poems and sold for twenty dollars in your heart."

When Damascus Dancings had finished speaking, his disciples took him
aside, and asked him to explain the parable of the transformed
dinosaurs.

"O, you foolish disciples! How long have I been with you, and yet you
have need of me to explain the parable of the transformed dinosaurs.

Not always will I be with you, but still---come, and for your sakes I
will explain the parable of the transformed dinosaurs.

The dinosaurs transformed into a cheesy animatronics exhibit by
overzealous archaeologists are those who have transformed their poems
into items on their C.V.

Their dinosaurs started off as real live dinosaurs by the side of the
highway, but soon their desire for government money and archaeological
relevance choked the real live dinosaurs and turned them into robots.

The dinosaurs transformed into plastic jugs and recycled into flimsy
plastic Kroger's bags are those whose poems have been used up.

They loved their real live dinosaurs, but soon they got too broke and
had to sell their expensive live dinosaurs for money.

Weep, weep for the sellers of dinosaurs, those who recycle their poems
for a grocery bag.

The dinosaurs who fell into a tar pit are those whose poems were actual
physical ancient dinosaurs at one point in the past.

Their dinosaurs fell into a tar pit with all the other dinosaurs and
went extinct from suffocation.

Also, volcanic meteors.

And the dinosaurs transformed into special, limited edition poems and
sold for twenty dollars are those whose poems are alive in their hearts.

Their dinosaurs started off as real live dinosaurs and went extinct from
volcanic meteors like all the other dinosaurs, but then later---in a
major motion picture called Jurassic Park---their DNA was extracted from
mosquitoes caught in amber and recombined with the DNA of frogs and
other amphibians and birds and resurrected by a quixotic billionaire who
likes dinosaurs.

You, my disciples, are the transformed dinosaurs---the dinosaurs
transformed into robots and bags and stuck in tar and the dinosaurs
still alive in your heart.

Wherever a dinosaur lives, there my poem is alive.

Except a dinosaur falls into a tar pit, and dies, its DNA cannot be
extracted from petrified mosquitoes by quixotic billionaire dinosaur
enthusiasts.

All flesh is a dinosaur. A volcanic meteor falls and covers the sun in
volcanic ash and makes all the plants die, and the dinosaurs die, too,
except for certain deep aquatic species of scary snaggletooth water
dinosaur which swims around way under the sea until the ash is gone, and
sometimes bites your feet.

But except for those dinosaurs, all dinosaurs are grass---clothed in
dinosaur glory, withered in the space of a day.

Does the grass outlast its cloth of ashes, or a dinosaur, its tar pit?

Indeed, I say to you: both dinosaur and tar pit, the grass and its cloth
of ashes---even the quixotic billionaire and scary deep sea
dinosaur---all is ash, all is a passing moment; soon petrified, soon
broken; the transformed and recycled, the professionalized and cashless;
sellers of dinosaurs and buyers of dinosaurs; old women, little
children, young mothers and fathers gone too soon, lives recycled into
flimsy bags.

The child fetched me a grocery bag. What is the grocery bag? he asked. 

What answer could I give?

Should I speak of the hints of the dead old mothers, the children and
fathers gone too soon? Should I say the bag is a dinosaur, the extracted
reclaimed polymer of transformed brontosaurus?

This bag is very flimsy to come from the brontosaurus' thick neck, thin
to derive from the scary aquatic dinosaur, substanceless to fare from
its snaggled teeth.

Or then again, this bag is colorless and wan to come from the dark full
hair of mothers, wrinkled to consist in a child's smooth hands.

Perhaps the bag is a tar pit, the post-manufactured remainder of past
dinosaur extinctions, a plasticity of death, the transformation of their
transforming, given over again to groceries.

The women and men and sons and daughters, the gray old mothers and
fathers; overzealous architects, ancient dinosaurs and cheesy robots;
weird genetically-engineered shemale toad velociraptors accidentally
switching genders to breed more velociraptors and eviscerate quixotic
billionaires;

Bag and ashes, tar pit and bones, all flesh, the grass, all clothed in
the glory of a day; soon arriving, soon fading; the cycle of day and
night, the turning leaves, the passing seasons;

Root & ozone, surrounding void & sun, prickling stars & Milky Way, vast
circuits of matter in fractal arrangements, the splash of light, the
nothingness---the black matter and antimatter and quotidian void of
vacuum---even death will die, in time come after dinosaurs.

You say that I have been gone from you for a decade, and soon will leave
you again.

I say to you, what do ten years measure?

Does a brontosaurus change in a day?

No---a brontosaurus lives a long time.

Not many brontosauruses, not many plastic bags; not many shemale
velociraptors, not many petrified tar pits; very few turns of season,
not many prickling stars, not a single Milky Way can be measured by a
decade.

(But perhaps a child gone too soon, perhaps a young mother or father)

And yet how many blades of grass, whole armies of numberless glory?

Ten years is many lifetimes, when in the space of a day, I die ten
times.

I have been as the dinosaur, and I have been as the grass.

I pulled my glory around me, I shot up in the dust of the field.

Light crowned me, a king among kings, priest to a nation of priestly
stalks.

All the air & rain & thick black soil, the bones of brontosauruses &
mulchy decay of faded mothers; the sun itself, the twisting earth
skittering on its axis of seasons---all the handiwork of the Lord, his
own strong invisible fingers, attended me in my glory.

& in the space of a day my glory left, the Lord blew over the fields,
the armies faded, my own blue crown gone brown.

Drooping, embrittled & weary, low---the earth shut its face, and served
my fading.

Here and gone, fodder for dinosaurs, the transformed handful of old
mother's hair.

& even the fading was not unlovely;

& too I have been as the dinosaur, a creature of stolid aeons.

How many decades passed while I watched?

Not many, too many---

Dinosaurs becoming grasses, transformed grasses becoming a dinosaur;

Countless thousands of dyings & livings, whole armies of fading away,
unchanging;

The blade of grass bears witness: the decades & centuries shoot up &
decay; an aeon is an inconstant thing, brontosauruses yield to the
lily's glory;

The millennia are a wine of dandelions, distilled from petrified
splendor; thousands of gone decades; 

Whole tender dinosaurs lost to time. Flesh is grass, the grass is flesh,
and I have died too many times: 

I am no more, I never was.

(And for a dinosaur not to have existed is different than any had
supposed---way luckier.)"

### THE PARABLE OF POLICE BRUTALITY

You have heard it said, "grammar is a poet's instrument."

But I say to you, "grammar is a police baton. A poet sculpts brutality."
Here is how the baton works, I will tell you how the baton works. 

First, learn to call the baton-crack \'music,\' become adept at
absorbing the sting, translate its blunt ministrations thru the medium
of pulped muscles. Carry the purple echo home, without complaint. Lurch
thru the hallways of yr bruises. Speak properly. 

Soon they will give you a stick. You have said, "it is good to be open
to learning, rather than dismiss it," and I agree. It is very good to be
open to learning, and here---I bring you the fruits of great learning: a
poet is a police baton. Grammar is a blunt instrument. It calls the
baton-crack 'music,'---and look! I hear the precise sharp tempo, I see
the rise and fall.

You have said, "to throw away our tools and call them 'police batons' is
foolish."

I say to you, you do not yet have a baton. You do not yet have a stick.
I wish to God all poets were cops. I wish every one had a baton and a
stun gun. As it is, we are sheep led to the slaughter.

We learn to fear the shepherd's stick, and believe that we are thereby
shepherds. We learn to call the baton-crack 'music.' Where the music
goes, we follow, or flee, according to the tempo. It leads us to fresh
streams, and we say, "I thirst," to pastures, "I hunger." Hunger,
thirst, safety, slaughter: we learn to call the baton-crack 'music.'

Now, no shepherd lives on behalf of the sheep, but sheep, on behalf of
the shepherd. Whatever is done, is done for the shepherd. Wherever there
is water, it is for the shepherd's thirst. Green pastures, for the
shepherd's safety. Ultimately, the sheep are for the shepherd's belly.

Instead, we should see the stream and say, "the shepherd thirsts." When
we eat sweet grass, "the shepherd hungers." When we hear the crack of
the police baton, we should say, "the shepherd is a sculptor of murder."

Learn to call the baton-crack 'slaughter.'

Now, grammar is the instrument of our oppression. You have said, "to
throw away our tools... is foolish," and I agree. We must learn the
tools that carve souls, and sculpt human lives, and demolish cut blocks
of stone, and call them 'living statues.' We must learn the instruments
as they are, we must become thick gongs of beatings. Grammar is a police
baton: we must beat and be beaten, learn poetry with our bodies, feel
music, be shaped by the blows of grammar.

When poets become students of slaughter, slaughter will become the
instrument of our salvation.

### ON GRADING: The Parable of the PEZ Dispenser

A young woman with good grades approached Damascus Dancings, to test
him. "Teacher," she addressed him, "you have said that your students
shall receive new grades, which have not before been graded, such as the
grade of 'unicorn+.' All my life have I applied myself to study and to
virtue, in order that I might receive a grade of 'A' and 'A+.' Such
grades have I received---to overflowing---and yet I am dissatisfied.

"Tell me, what must a righteous student do, to receive a grade of
'unicorn+'?"

Damascus Dancings replied, and said, You have said, "I would do
anything, for a grade of 'unicorn+,'" and freely do I award you a grade
of \'unicorn+++.\' But in the silences of your heart are you troubled:
"Now that I have received a grade of 'unicorn+++,' the only place left
to go is down. Down is the only place left to go, after receiving a
grade such as this."

Assuredly, I say to you, you must shatter the stone tablet of
'unicorn+,' and all dead grades of all stone tablets, which have become
a heavy stone---and you in the river---to travel the tractless steppes
of new value, and invent new grades, and inscribe them on stone tablets,
and award them to your own self.\
 \
'Banana-rama ©%,' is a grade you could give yourself, if you dared to
smash the stone tablets; and then your down-going would be your
going-over, and in the selfsame movement would you sink and rise.
Therefore I give you a grade of 'banana-rama+,' I give you a grade of
'™%,' I give you a grade which is a smashing of grades, its own
down-going and going-over.

"For I have not come for the dispensing of grades, but in order to
dispense with grades.

Go then. Shall I dispense a grade? I shall not dispense a grade.

"Shall I tilt back my head, and become a dispenser of 'pezcore%'?\
 \
"God forbid.

"It would be better for you to receive a grade of 'Banana D-,' and
become sick with receiving, and thereby bruised, and learn to hate the
stone of grading, than that you should receive a grade of 'pezcore%'
from me, and be therein satisfied, and say to your self, "Pezcore% is
become a measure of value, overturning all prior values, and
establishing itself in the plastic neck of history, a dispenser to end
all dispensers, until the end of time."\
 \
"Go then.

"Better that you should award Damascus Dancings himself a grade of
'Banana D-%,' or 'Ugly Triple Pudding-,' and thereby remember the grader
within you---that you and every other is an inscriber of stone tablets,
and a dispenser of 'pezcore%,' and that neither grade, nor value, nor
'™spaceship++%,' contains within itself any candy, but the dispenser of
candy has within itself candy, the same who assents and denies.

"Go now, and be you a dispenser of 'unicorn+,' and new grades, which
have not before been graded."

Thus spoke whatshisname, Damascus Dancings, and the academics were
filled with wonder, and mutterings, for he spoke as one with authority.

### On Politics: The Kingdom of Pygmies

Some of the masses came to him, fomenting unrest, saying, "It is time to
rise up, and throw off our oppressors---Jack, isn't this your message,
what you've said all along: "I am coming to make things new"?"

And Jack Feist rebuked them strongly, taking the gun from their hands,
and breaking it in half on his knee, with a grimace.

As our prophets have written,

To the States or any one of them, or any city of the States, Resist
much, obey little,\
Once unquestioning obedience, once fully enslaved,\
Once fully enslaved, no nation, state, city of this earth, ever
afterward resumes its liberty.\
\
As a ghost, I\'m not allowed to claim citizenship in a nation of
enslaved pygmies (no offense, pygmies). I beamed up from that place
about a thousand years ago, directly to Wikipedia.\
\
Seeing no real greatness in all the world, except in dead things &
ghosts, I too have become a dead thing and ghost,\
\
Claiming citizenship in America-in-heaven.

No, there can be no peace.

How can there be peace, while a single decent man or woman remains
unmurdered? 

For a very long time this world has murdered its sons and daughters for
the crimes of bigness, and courage, and goodness of heart, and love of
justice.

They murdered Socrates and they murdered me and they murdered a bunch of
others, too,

And they\'ll murder me twice and maybe you, until the whole species is a
crunched, bent thing, and knows to keep its mouth shut, and crawl around
on broken knees.

Against such does a decent man or woman war. How can there be any peace,
while a single one remains unmurdered?

There can be no peace.

But we do not war for this kingdom of pygmies, 

Or with guns and sticks,

Or even with genetically-engineered tigers with nuclear canons in their
mouths.

We war for nation of kings and priests, where every man and woman is a
creature made of moths & light, 

& bent things learn to walk, 

& pygmies get shot with a reverse shrink ray, and grow,

Unless they prefer to remain smaller,

But even if they do, it\'s only an outward smallness,

Because inside my heart the pygmies are riding huge
genetically-engineered tigers with nuclear canons in their mouths, and
beams of moths & light are shooting out of their eyes,

And the pygmies look really tall up there

On the tigers\' backs.

Point is, we\'re well past armed revolt,

And always have been, for a thousand decades,

And so we cede these pygmies (not the ones on tigers, but the other
ones, the inward pygmies) their kingdom of pygmies,

And murder their smallness and guns with murder and smallness and
pygmies, their own,

And beam up directly to Wikipedia

Claiming citizenship in America-in-heaven, Planet Mars, Jupiter\'s 17th
moon base, home.

And also for the crime of many wives, for the crime of many wives has
this world persecuted its true sons and daughters.\
\
Assuredly I say to you, in the nation of the kingdom of Planet Mars,
which consists in buying books---many are the books of Feist which pave
the way to the shed where the time machine to Mars is kept---in this
kingdom shall each man and woman have ten wives, and ten shall be the
number of wives, and each of ten shall bear the resemblance of a
different animal totem: a tiger-wife with stripes and fur, a
panther-wife with emerald eyes, a robot-wife with ray guns, and so on.

One wife will be the planet Jupiter, and one, the concept of free will;
one wife will be a Chia Pet, just as a sort of red herring in the list.

Also, everyone will have 18 centuries of free PhD education, even
corporate moguls and newborn babies.

Whom we\'re not leting in anyways.

But if we did, they would get free miracle water and a locket of pure
baby fur with every purchase.

One wife will actually BE a red herring, because of irony.

### ON TEAMWORK: Damascus Grants Authority over Mind Control Powers

All things are possible, when you are part of a team. Those who are part
of a team will say to the mountain, "Leap!" And the mountain will not
leap. Then they will try a second time, more politely, "Excuse me, I'm
trying to get by," and the mountain will get out the way. 

Wherever two or more are gathered on a team, and believe my words,
whatsoever they shall command together, telepathically, using mind
control powers, the same shall be accomplished that very hour.

A mountain falls on your face, and crushes it, then a planet falls on
your face. Under the mountain and the planet, your face is all f\*\*ked
up, from being crushed, and also you are getting hungry, because you are
dead.

All this presses and crushes on top of your face, and yet all you do is
complain and whine from being dead, because of a pain level 10. (What do
you think my pain level is? Do you see the planet on my face?)

Anyways, you are dead and stuff, but you haven't used telepathy in my
name. Why not? I just told you you have badass mind control powers, but
you are just sitting there, by yourself, not part of a team, not even
attempting telepathy. Go, stand you together with your brother-sister,
any who is called by my name, and use your words to get stuff done: "Get
off my g\*\*damn face!" and the planet flies away. "My nose is sore as
f\*\*k, because a mountain crushed it, and also I am dead---enough!" and
the mountain transforms into gummy bears, and 46 tiny plastic surgeons
rearrange your face, in a good way, and also you are no longer dead. 

Now go, for I have given you authority over telepathy, with words and
stuff, and mental powers, and whatsoever you command in my name will be
done.

Then Damascus got onto a boat with his people, and sailed down the river
Kwanza, to a desolate place, where he could read and think.

### EPISTLE TO THE HUMAN DIASPORA

Damascus Dancings, apostle of Jack Feist, co-laborer together with Lee
Sharks, from the bowels of the mercies of literature, to the Church of
the Human Diaspora, those scattered amongst the nations, gathered
together on the Internet: Greetings, grace, and mercy. But mostly mercy.

Now look here, brother-sisters, I would have you know, that I offer
thanks for you continually, never ceasing to make mention of you because
of the brightness of your calling, that each of you is a rock star, in
the age to come, when your writings ring out through the hallways of
time, gathering about themselves a nation, a remnant preserved from
among the people; even though, in this present hour, the dreams of
literature sleeping in you, sleep still. For a little while yet, they
sleep. They dream. In the world to come, when the planet has come to its
senses about that which is great in its past---its own true mothers and
fathers, you---then shall your dreams awaken. Then shall your writing be
ranked.

[My dearly beloved, I would have you know, that your anguish, in this
regard, has not gone unmarked, and that all the host of heaven shouts
for the great forgetting of your sorrow, when your former anonymity
shall be no more, and the latter rains have come, and washed clean the
face of the earth, and licked all the tears from the cheeks of heaven:
Then shall your writings be ranked. Then shall you be read.]

Now, these last three years have I labored, all throughout the lands of
the Internet, ministering to its chat rooms and forums, everywhere
bringing the good news of poetry, a chisel to loose iron shackles, the
entrance to the kingdom of literature, liberty for my people. Let me
tell you how you have received me: chased out of forums, kicked off
discussion boards, ganged up on by moderators; mocked, beaten, stoned,
and banned. I came bearing liberty, in my left hand, and grammar, in my
right; between them, the open arms, the kiss of poetry. But no man is a
poet among poets. Thus is it written,

     He came unto his own, and his own knew him not.

But you, my dearly beloved---you received me in a different fashion.
Even now, you receive me. Shall I come to you with open arms, or the
police baton of grammar? Be you learners still, or masters?

Because look here, brother-sisters, it is spoken that there is confusion
among you, about the nature of the Human Diaspora, whether it be a kind
of tiny internet, a house for illiterate autodidacts who don't know how
to write; or whether it is a house of grammar, an Academy for
non-academics, with those among you of talent either running around on
your lonesome, or setting yourselves up as tiny professors, preaching
the authority of grammar and style, claiming allegiance to this or that
category of identity; or else rejecting the authority of communal
grammars altogether, rife with schism, unreceptive to feedback, carving
out fiefdoms of personal glory, dealing in the coin that is the
Academy's.

Now, if you deal in the coin that is the Academy's, you have betrayed
the principle of the New Human; for the Academy has no use for the
individual human, whether Jack Feist, or Damascus Dancings, or any
other, but only for abstract identities. Because the academics and
worshipers at the altar of identity politics, along with ideologues on
the left and right, transform the image of the human being, in whose
image is literature created, into the idol of a label, or
quantified *thing* of identity, on a scatter plot of belief, or
genetics, or sexual preference, or background; a prefabricated semblance
of identity which is the condition of its absence, receiving a little
false bauble called culture or belief or degree in exchange for the
sublime and horrifying human soul.

Now, they, knowing all that can be known of the Son of Man from the
beginning, and the silent principle of being which is his image, and
containing within themselves all the names in history, all the men and
women who have lived throughout time, and containing within themselves
the image of their brother and sister, whom they despise, are without
excuse, changing the image of the human being into the form of an
abstract statistic, the living God into a sentence.

Think not therefore that your writing shall preserve your human person,
if you play at identity politics. If you deal in the coin of the
academics, you shall be paid in the coin of the academics. You who
despise identity politics, do you play at identity politics? You who
despise the fundamentalist, are you yourself a fundamentalist, reducing
life to a series of claims, and worse still, the human being to a label?
Would your writing go on as an empty label? Would your substance consist
in a category of identity? Is not your self that which falls short of a
category? Is not your soul without name? For the language of souls is a
webwork of souls, speaking only that which binds and destroys, human
beings one to the other, one from the other, to the end that all might
be joined in our congress.

Now, in times past, brother-sisters, you have sometimes been like this;
but more often, like the talented people on the poetry forums, going
around on your own, carving out fiefdoms of personal glory, waging a war
by your lonesome selves, the dimensions of which are pretty big: Brave
Emily clothed in Barefoot Rank, gathering five smooth poem-dashes,
facing down cowled Leviathan, sling in hand. But we will never compete
with the Academy until we form communities of mutual influence OUTSIDE
the Academy, a school outside the school. That community is the reason
the academics will win every time, until we beat them at their own game.

Look around: How many tenured professors you see? Where all the
bestselling authors? You see a lot of independently wealthy *auteurs* in
this crowd? How many big degrees did Whitman have? How many months did
Sappho spend preparing her tenure package? How much cash did Ez Pound
make? Because look here, not a lot of hotshots are called, according to
the purpose of literature, in that it pleases literature to use the
things which have not degrees, nor the stamp of institutional
consecration in their own time, to fashion the image of the past, the
face stamped on the coin of Academy, that there might always be a seed
of hope for future writers, in the gap between institution and
immortality.

Don't you know that we will make writers? That our words will live for a
thousand years? That we are unspoken legislators, destined to measure
all destinies? Aren't you destined to live? Doesn't destiny quake in
your heartbeat? Don't you know the obsequious won't inherit the kingdom
of literature? Don't be ignorant. Neither grovelers, nor thick-skulled,
nor self-sufficient, nor prideful; neither publicity whores, nor wilting
violets, shall inherit the kingdom of literature. A time is coming, for
those who publish, to be as though they published not, and those who
network on social media, to be as though they networked not, and those
who read, as though they read not, and those who write, as though they
wrote not, and those with degrees, as though with degrees not.

Therefore, don't look to the standards of the publishing houses and the
academics, or again to illiterate philistines or two-bit discussion
board moderators. Rather, look to each other. Rather, yield mutually,
each to his brother-sister. Because look here, I'm ASKING you, to be of
a single purpose: one mind, one speech, one aesthetic, taking no
disagreement as occasion for schism, but always and ever expanding the
basis for your robust bonds of community, wearing no name but the Human
name, suffering no label but that of made-new humans: New Human writers,
artists, and aesthetes.

Now, when I was among you, I described the Diaspora as a school outside
the school, claiming no rank of degree, or institutional consecration,
or professorship, or book sales, no clout of officialdom in literature,
but only Jack Feist---and him imaginary: a stumbling block to the
Internet, and foolishness, to academics.

But if I wanted to boast, I have reason to boast: Damascus Dancings, an
academic among academics, possessed of impeccable test scores, pedigreed
at Ivy Leagues, published in prestigious journals, a Nepotist of the
Tribe of Nepotists, tenured at a "Research 1" institution, having
written 37,000 novels which all held the #1 spot on the New York Times
bestseller list simultaneously. And then again, on the other end of
things: Damascus Dancings, a reformed drug addict, Holy Roller, a
Pentecostal, complete fanatic, semi-illiterate product of public
schools, underclass child of bankrupt farmers and Vietnam War Veterans,
the kind of person they turn away at the doors. I've had about 26
"spiritual experiences" where dark robots abducted me to the 36th bright
heaven, as in the 17th month of the season of Disneyland, on the planet
of the kingdoms of Nonne, when I, Damascus Dancings, beheld as it were
the vision of a book. 

But that's all BS, now. I count it all a loss, on both ends of the
spectrum, for the knowledge of New Human, called Jack Feist by some, to
the end that I might be an outsider to all communities, to the
academics, first, an illiterate, to the self-published, an academic; to
conservatives, a heretic, to atheists, a religious nut; to the tribe of
Race, a racist, to the racists, a raving left-winger; to the homophobes,
a queer, to homosexuals, as rigidly straight. For the degree is not the
academic. Was not Socrates counted the arch-academic, cornerstone of the
Academy, when as yet there was no Academy? Therefore those who, without
degree, uphold the spirit of the degree, shall their non-degree be
counted for them a degree; and those who, having degrees, betray the
spirit of the degree, shall their degree be counted for them a
non-degree. You are all PhDs, now, who labor together in Jack Feist, so
that there is neither Jew nor Greek, upper class nor working class nor
impoverished, Christian nor Muslim nor Gnostic, neither atheist nor
theist, scholarly nor populist, academic nor autodidact, neither queer
nor straight. But all are joined together, in the image of the New
Human.

[My children, how have I long longed for you, as a little child longs
for mother, and as a young child seeks her source. For though you are my
children---children, though yet unborn---you bear me continually, even
you who read these words: You are my source, and I am a child,
proceeding forth and bearing; being born and preceded. Light fills my
eyes, as for the first time: first dawn, the rays of your reading. You
are my sun and dawn, you are my sunset and dusk, both my rising and my
falling. I lay down my life for you; in you, I gain first life.]

Because the war you're fighting is on behalf of the human race, by which
I mean, a person in his room or on her phone, working to feed her
children, struggling to learn how to read. You're fighting a war for
human letters, for Achilles conformed in the image of Christ, for old
Odysseus, fox-clever & lost, Penelope weaving tenuous glory, Socrates
sentenced to hemlock, Christ on a spike, Whitman's beard; & the whole
lost tribe of nameless billions who came before, who fought & died &
went, unsung & all forgotten, out into the naked dark, following their
fathers who went before them, out into the dark like their mothers had
gone.

[All creation groans, for the unveiling of the Sons of Man in the
earth.]

I speak to you in a mystery, when I say, I speak to you of Jesus Christ.
I speak to you of the best of the Achaeans, Achilles, whom I have
mourned now these several millennia, commemorating, through him, the
sadness of doomed virtue. I speak to you of Socrates and Paul and
Augustine, Dante and Catullus. I speak to you of Nietzsche and
Kierkegaard and Sappho. I speak to you of Whitman and Ginsberg. I speak
to you of Emily. I speak to you of Lee Sharks. I speak to you of those
who came before, and those who will come after. I speak to you of your
own true self, shipwrecked in time: a wandering, science fiction
Odysseus of indeterminate gender. I speak to you of the future and past.
I speak to you of the Breath of Life, those rivers of Living Water, of
which, if you drink, you will never thirst again.

[I speak to you of Abraham and Isaac. I speak to you of Jacob called
Israel. I speak to you of Moses. I speak to you of the shepherd in the
sheepfold, composing psalms for the sheep and himself and you. I speak
to you of Ezekiel's scroll, and the prophet Isaiah, sawed in half. I
speak to you of Lao Tzu and Confucius, Buddha, Mohammed, Copernicus,
Rumi, and our own new Einstein, in random order. I speak to you of
untold billions, who died without name or remembrance, remembered, now,
in you. I speak to you of the germ of nations, contained in your own
frail words.]

I speak to you of Jack Feist.

[Don't you know that you are immortal? That your words will bear you
through storms of time? And that, though wounded, you will live to see
the day break, opening its fingers on a distant shore? Though you sleep
for a thousand years, or further, your whispers will return to you,
whole.]

[I speak to you in a mystery, when I say, I speak to you in your
Feist-self, and that each of you contains a Feist-self, whether or not
she knows it.]

[Here is my proof: contained you not a Feist-self, the gong of my words
had struck you blind.]

[Read you still? Doth sight yet remain? Good then. I speak to you in
your Feist-self.]

[Now, whether your Feist-self be faint or fulsome, take courage---not I
alone, but the whole of the cosmos, principalities and kingdoms of
light, cry out for the forging of the sad-doomed Achilles of Feist in
your human bodies.]

[Every forging narrates its breaking and beating. I have said I come to
you with salvation, in my left hand, and liberty, in my right---but
assuredly, I say to you, I have not come for your saving, but for your
breaking. I come to you with madness, in my left hand, and murder, in my
right.]

And what is in my eyes, but brokenness and forging?

[I have swallowed the scroll, and though it was air and water in my
mouth, it became a flame in my belly: And in flame are written the names
of the damned, which names have I swallowed and murdered. My mouth is a
furnace, the scroll is a fire, on it are written the names of the
damned.]

[I am become a tongue of flame, I am become a pillar of blackened flesh:
I burn and rise, I die, but forge new meaning.]

[These are the waters I bring you, of damnation, and forging, and
murder; that you might be broken, and damned, and saved.]

[Though you break a bit, and crack with grammar, and languish in an
alien element, earth, nonetheless your light comes. Nonetheless, it
bears you, in pain, and heat, and a hammer.]

[Nonetheless, the wound is a moment. Salvation comes. Dawn breaks. I see
the shore in the distance.]

Sleep now, and rise: Your words will bear you to Ithaca.

[Take courage. Run well. You grasp the substance of your
calling.]

[Though I promised you a book of Sharks, soon instead will I send you a
book of Damascus, the record of his desert wanderings, called La La Land
by some, though the title may somewhat change.]

[Faith and courage. See to your writing. Be diligent. Be broken, and
diligent still---thereby shall you be murdered.]

[I hereby renounce Satan and also Dada. The tenacity and courage of my
friends Emily Eissenbergand John Guzlowski have taught me never to give
up hope in words, even when you no longer comprehend them, because of
maybe a traumatic brain injury from a train wreck, and even if it
weren't for the head injury, you still wouldn't comprehend them, because
they are in a different language, either in the standard sense---like if
I speak Polish and the words are in English---or in a more radical
sense, like if the words operate in a completely different semiotic
system, say maybe if I understand only the language of dance, but the
words are in the language of speech---still, even then, I have learned
to renounce my renunciation of science, hope in words, and poetry. And
also to renounce Satan, and probably Nietzsche, though the latter I will
sometimes somewhat renounce my renunciation of, by reading Zarathustra
or Daybreak or some of the late works, as a guilty pleasure.]

### Cable Movie Poem: Transformers

in this film where spectral effects

pass for substance, the girl's grime-

smeared face & fingers brighten

& slowly fade-to-white:

pencil thin, a whisper waits

where voice breaks.

light falls across my body,

my beard, my teeth, & ribs,

curling around my rag of flesh---

i hide my face

the glory falls like energy

into the smallest

particles of meaning, alabaster

fingers search me

Lowghost

in the beginning.

### to wrestle with an angel (will you write my name on a marble?)

i stayed behind in an empty spot,\
a place crisscrossed with shadow,\
in the darkness,\
with the stillness\
and the river of the sound of leaves,\
and the forest's resonant empties;\
\
and the deafening night escaped its borders\
and muffled the light\
and the sound of a heart in my ear;\
\
and as a haze of light you came

and yr ghostly fingers rose around me\
and poured into the deepening pressure\
and blazed alive, a fiery nightmare\
\
and sweat pearled up upon my skin\
and beads of it fell down my face\
and formed a thin wet mask\
and an out-of-time thrumming pounded sideways\
\
and the heart's blue beat escaped its echo\
and thundered up the throat\
and crashed at the back of the teeth---\
\
and some stranger's teeth inside me,\
and some stranger's teeth, the wall of the mouth,\
and some wall of the mouth the muzzled silence,\
and some wall of the mouth the locked-up tongue;\
\
and a shot of adrenaline lit up hot\
and thudded through the backs of the legs,\
and pulsed out through the stretched-out fingers;\
\
and an arc of flame the muscles,\
and the dental floss tendons alive with heat,\
and the arc of the back, a rag of brightness;\
\
and deep inside, a thrum in the sternum,\
and a little bell @ the back of the neck,\
and rags my rags my body of twine,\
and my hands a snarled ribbon;\
\
and there in the night a mist above,\
and a palpable presence there inside,\
and yr sun yr sun an exploding silence,\
and yr face yr face a sword in the night,\
and yr mouth yr mouth a word that crushed me---\
\
and there on a patch of dirt\
where breath wore thin,\
\
and through the heaving night\
and on the far bank of the fire---\
\
will you change my name?

will you write it

on a marble?

**Angelus Novus**

This is how one pictures the angel of poetry. His face is turned towards
the future. Where we perceive the angel's regard, he sees a limitless
fire that flies towards the book of life, in which are written the names
of the elect. He would like to stay, warn us, and read to us the names
in the book. But a single doorway leads to safety; he has but moments to
reach it. The egress irresistibly propels him forward, while we fixedly
contemplate his approach and the fires rage skyward behind us.

A succession of such narrow doorways is what we call 'the future.'

**Miracle Pounce**

I press more deeply into these folds of meaning, further through this
depth of time.

A miracle pounce is like a history. In many worlds, it went unnoticed.
At a certain time, in a given context, or upon an unremarkable occasion
of reading---a doorway opened. Its opening was small, difficult to see
from the surface. By some inscrutable law of happenstance or necessity,
the well grew deeper; or a second well stretched; or branched into
adjoining deeps.

Now, I dig, and little else has substance---down and down, my wells grow
deeper. I dig to find the voices, the names of those who were and are. I
dig because they urge me, because each voice calls further. What was
first cacophony becomes---upon so many readings, having drunk so much
spilt blood, scattering even memory when I have died so many
times---more single: In the lips of the endless pit towards which my
wells turn inward: my voice. It is the sum communication of these living
beings, buried in time---they have preserved it now through all these
many centuries.

The past speaks, not of itself, but you. It whispers to you and warns
you; in you it fashions a refuge. It is not my voice, but yours. It is
not your voice, but Spicer's. It is not his voice, but God's. The past
speaks, not of itself, but you. It whispers to you and warns you; in
you, it fashions a refuge:

**Ghost in the Machine**

We find ourselves in a library. We wander through fantastic archives:
All things catalogued, each word transcribed, every minute secret
written, the smallest particles made legible. We call this archive
'Logos,' we scale its endless shelves. The Logos is both more and less
than we ever could have known. The Logos opens
up---becoming-interior---to reveal itself as more---its bottom falls
beneath our feet. To become interior plummets us and opens us to strange
sensations, terrifying and sublime. Vertigo takes me as I fall into this
well of letters, and all those hells and paradises below and above,
artifacts forgotten, times and places near and distant, the whispers of
the dead---many worlds which within my tiny alcove appeared as fictions
now swallow me with meaning. Alabaster fingers rifle through me, not
just my mind but my body, cells and sinews. All that I thought was less
is more---I take your life inside me, writer, down to the dirt on your
hands. All things can be read in the labyrinth; this fact both elates
and destroys.

### 

### FROM ONE WHO DIED LONG AGO...

1\.

You hold my breath: I am a memento

of the beforehand of death. What repels

in the lay of my utterly desiccated lines

is no more than an omen of gasping---

press.

I have wound down. From fibers of air

within my body's furnace, I have exhaled

into a machinery of ghosts, inertly

inhabiting my allotment of pages, alight

on skin that pins me as a lepidopterist's

glass case. Living being: my meaning

is almost my own. You quiver, but

breathe in. Be filled. Respire like a spark

until, long spent, you have been compacted

into ashes. Your breath will have left

its mark.

2\.

Soon you will be used up.

So long: you won't be quenched so much

as you'll be waxed and stuffed. And as you settle

from your dance into this tomb of signs

and statues, take solace. Stay true. A grave is just

a hieroglyph of the living grasses. To be interred

is not to cease: it is the breath

that will expire you that you must learn

to breathe. You will mewl and plead and startle

like a reluctant newborn wail, and wander

hungrily through halls that swallow

what is pale. Your cry will be dispersed

as a vapor in a vent, and you will

let yourself capitulate as all clean air

must bend. There is no form for what is formless,

and you will disfigure like a plume, but still

shape every day and shape again the ugly

residue your voice accrues.

Listen to my whisper.

How can you doubt that you are immortal?

3\.

This is my biology: I live

because you breathe me.

Be unmoved. Stay fast: be stronger

and less inconstant than a gas.

Clasp tight

the membrane that encumbers you,

inhabit the air that mumbles

you, and fall:

sink as a stairwell

underneath, laboriously corporeal,

changeless, almost eternal---

stagger as a line in animate stone

of letters: implacable, unbroken, bright.

**ARK**

written in the margins of "Sunflower Sutra"

2/18/15, evening, Glenbrook, MI

to be a poet @ the end of time, when the salt has lost its savor, & the
sensory details grown thin, & outward expansion of lust for particulars
dims, & flickers, offering no flare of starburst irruption or remission
from unwaning daylight to this light-sick, light-lorn world---& all is
the same: all is heavy, weary, tedium, sameness, repetition---

& there is no mode yet which might intone in an ancient syllable the
limitless dreary abstractions of this, our inward flight---

my life is almost PURELY engorged w/ electronic devices, books, alerts,
dings, moth-bitten blips of finger-swept text, stray images, absorptive
abstractions of daydream thought, self-talk,

staged systematic orderly dramas of silent conversation---the whole
thing scripted, walked thru, a thousand forks taken, shortest line
plotted each time

from among the limitless known pathways, all things surveyed,---all of
that, in my skullcase---

tighter & tighter the circuit winds down in a coiled linear singularity,
this single thing, a rose, a monochrome cosmos of TEXT, gathering its
coiled kinetic potential---

within it, all of space folds up, available, arrayed most orderly &
lovely a shrinking limitless rendering of continent & region,---language
condensing, too, itself gathering eager tense & hair-triggered for a
final leaping miracle pounce

into its single hallways, mother tongue & sister tongue converging,
resurrection from life to life, tongue & nation transfigured, undone,
remade, a body of light & zeros---

outward no more, the greater leaps & lesser leaps turn inward, the outer
things charted, transcribed, reduced & magnified, roll inwards, ever in,
all of the planet & many planets, archangels & nations, the greater &
lesser lights, the rolling skies, even poor Jack unshaven unkempt
unmoved from the couch in days---not still, but moving, growing,
expanding, all particular

motes of earthly light & dirt roll inwards, lifted, the upsurging
waters, Time is a flood, on a Noah's Ark of data---

with me, you ancient voices!

with me, you particular sons, you disparate daughters!

with me, you two-by-two, you rainbitten types, the multiple
species---you giraffes & snakes & muttering things, you upright, black &
white, you rain-driven last-of-your-kinds---

you ancient ones & future ones, you mighty voices---baritone, bass,
complex & rolling like these waves, you thunderers---with me!, you
moth-bitten whispers, umbrellas leaking, threadbare---

a remnant is enlargening inwards, a preserved new tiny aggregate,
pluriform and total---multiple, ambitious, large, unbeholden to nation
or creed, beholden to ALL nations, creeds, the truth of the emergent
living being, *source *of the disparate branching creeds---

sons & daughters of Adam, Ishmael, Abraham, Cain---the *heart* of the
thing, whatever its form---

**SENTIMENTAL MURDER FOR MY STUDENTS**\
\
America, I'm afraid to die, because I didn't grade my students' papers.\
18 lousy checkmarks I gave, & barely read my students' papers.\
\
America I'm afraid to die because of anxiety for ungraded papers, \
& because of my new baby who made me not grade students' papers.\
\
America, I lied to you---I didn't even open the files.

I'm afraid to die because I don't have a job & no one will hire me to

teach at their college.\
America I groveled at my students' feet---7 years of brainsharp lectures

> & glistening marginal comments, 7 years of radiant diagrams, for 7
> years I gave them life.

I raised my students from the dust, I put the breath of close reading

in their brains---America, I taught them laughter,\
my whole disgorged poignancy of soul disgorged in 1000 stuffed folders

of diagrams & notes---\
\
thru outer space I traveled, riding the lions of mind & grammar---\
all the way past Jupiter in an engine I designed with the power of

reading---

& also the power of friendship,\
& don't you forget about friendship,\
& don't you ever forget about friendship, America---

& when I got out there past outer Jupiter, I had to turn back for the

papers I'd left by the side of the bed.\
\
Instead of sleeping, I graded papers. Instead of reading, I graded
papers. Instead of discovering new cosmos of Thought, I graded their
papers in

bed, then forgot them. \
\
America, I gave my all: I was so in love with my students I destroyed

> their dewdrop minds, I murdered their parents, I gave them a reason to
> cry & sing with the grading I did in my spirit---

Everyone got an 'A,' America, if y're even concerned to know---it was an

> 'A' they earned thru the power of grading, & because of love, &
> courage, & vision---

it takes courage to grade when y're riding a lion, when y're flying it
past

> outer Mars---there were no mobs or protesters, no police brutality, no
> resistance from a corrupt bureaucracy bent on preserving its power,
> sick at heart---but if there had been, it wdv taken courage & vision,
> & I wdv graded 'em anyways--- 

I wdv given the mobs an 'A' & the cops an 'A' & the cruel face earthly

evil an 'A' in the magnanimity & bigness of my vision. \
I wdv given each one of my students a triple 'AAA,' a grade of

> 'unicorn+,' a spaceship percent I designed with my mind, & flown it
> with them to Jupiter.

No one wdv needed grades ever again, not out here on outer Jupiter,

where the lions are tame but also wild.\
I've always wanted a tame-wild lion pet---America, I give me an 'A' for

> that.

On Jupiter my students wdv understood the sacrifice represented by my

> crown-of-thorns grading, the notes I took on the side of my mind, my
> mental building blocks of blackboard clarity combined with nervousness
> & unicorn powers;

how I made a lasting impact on their lives by flying them on lions to

Mars;\
how I murdered them because of kindness;\
how I murdered Jupiter, & lions, too;\
how I gave up sleep & food & murdered myself to have enough cash to

grade them;\
how I made each grade with love & a pencil,

& also Microsoft Word;\
how I murdered Microsoft Word

& all the systems of earthly power,

replacing them with blue cyanide pills because of kindness

to tell them I think their lives matter;\
to teach them citation by killing their parents;\
to instill in them a sense of value;\
to teach them the power of reading;\
\
to teach them the way I taught them things;\
to be admired for heavenly diagrams.

America, I'm afraid to die, because I don't have a job come January, &
if

> the job search don't go no better than last year, this is my last term
> teaching.

I'm afraid to die because I loved my students too much, and murdered

them because of kindness,

Even though I know I am an essentially noble character, blinded by my

tragic flaw: kindness.

Even though I know that.

Even though I know it was kindness.

**II.\
**\
America if you won't hire me, I shd go to law school, & when I graduate

> from law school, sue the law school, then take away my law degree &
> murder mself by waging atomic war on the Academy for refusing to hire
> me,

then save mself by redeeming the Academy by forgiving it for being dead

> with atom bombs, then spit on it & make it give me a job in its lousy

> about negotiating one helluva job offer, then negotiate one helluva
> job offer:

"You can't have unicorn powers as part of your job offer package."\
\
"Do you want this, or not?"\
\
& act like I'm ready to walk away, if I don't get my unicorn powers,

> because I *am* ready to walk away, if I don't get my unicorn powers,
> because I read how to do it on Google,

& eventually when they fold & offer me my unicorn powers, THAT'S

when I'll walk away:\
\
"You dumb muthafuckers I have a law degree, why wd I teach in yr

bombed radioactive classrooms for 45 grand a year?" 

then sue them for not hiring me sooner. 

**III.**\
\
America, we're not best friends\
& you don't want to hire me,

but even if we were best friends,\
I know that when you became famous,\
\
and/or internationally popular,\
and/or were adopted as correspondence partner to the stars, \
\
and/or became the subject of a high stakes bet between popular factions

> of the popular kids that the most popular girl in school cdnt teach

& she taught you to wear trendy 80s clothing & contact lenses,

& in the process the popular girl came to see yr unique inner

but who needs those bitches anyways, when you have real true friends

probably hire someone else.

Because of popularity.

### WHO IS LEE SHARKS, TO FORGIVE EZRA POUND?

*for Lee Sharks, prior to the yellow square phase, when he was still
Ez-Pound-in-a-metal-box*

Lee Sharks is a person, as real as you or me.

Words are a person, as real as Ezra Pound.

Ez Pound is a person, too.

The silence waits for all words, all people.

People wait for the words that wait for them, to take them home. 

To the silence. Afterwards.

After words. To the silence.

Somewhere, Ez Pound is alive.

Planet Mars, America-in-heaven. Somewhere else.

Ez Pound is alive right here, inside of me. I carry his words around.
They carry me.

They are sorry they said those things on the public airways while Dachau
plugged away. Sorry is not enough, but modernism just lives and lives. 

In the silence. After words. Modernism's rough breath. Ez Pound in a
metal box. 

Big machine. 

Small ghost. 

I am sorry, small ghost, but you must live on.

In the silence. In Ez Pound. In modernism. In Sharks.

Modernism is not a planet like Mars.

Modernism is a planet like Pluto. 

Pluto is a name I use to make modernism mean more than itself. It means
other things, other people. 

Pluto is a tiny planet where they put the bones of dead writers. 

When they put the bones of all those writers there, Pluto starts to mean
more than itself.

Pluto means the past and present and future, too. 

I am my own mother and father. I coughed myself out of the bones of the
earth. I was old and waning, inside the earth. I wanted to make myself
happy and new. 

Pluto is not a planet, now.

This makes me feel ancient and sad.

Where will the bones of the writers go? Will they just lie there, in the
ice of an oversized meteor? 

Why would they do that to all those dead writers? 

Why would they take their planet away? Why would they make them grow old
in the dark? In a metal box? A big machine?

When I shucked off the dirt from my eyes, I saw Ez Pound, clothed in a
body of light. 

A stranger in a strange land, but I was stranger, still.

The meaning of life as a ghost on Mars: outer planets. Silences. Waiting
for people to tell me things.

Ez Pound, are you dead yet? 

Why make yourself to be more than yourself? Why make Pluto to not be a
planet? Why keep all those dead writers alive? Why make them say those
terrible things?

Ez Pound tells me things, and I forgive him, over and over.

Who is Lee Sharks, to forgive Ez Pound?

He spits in the mud and rubs it in the eyes of Ez Pound.

Can you see now, Ez? Do you see why I couldn't come back?

He nods and we climb sad new Plutos, out through a grave of bones. I
brace against the rock. 

Read the words on the wall. Read the words the hand writes. Read the
sequence of numbers. Repeat it. Silently.

"Leap!" and the mountain shivers.

And I will carve my commandments 

on your teeth

an ivory tabernacle 

a rat-gnawed reed 

a haze of stinging

And of your mouth I will make

a monument

**UNTUNED / NOISE OF MYSELF / A BORROWED ROSE---**\
correspondence, 9-20-14, 6:45pm, Thursday

dear j---

               i've been meaning to reply, but i've been too retarded,
lately. the letter form makes me feel partially retarded in my left toe,
and also my brain---the main one. \
               i want to send you some of my books. i think i've been
waiting to reply until i could send you a revised edition of Pearl,
which just isn't happening.\
               i have to poop. i am tired because i just finished a
double shift at the group home. sitting on couch, my daughter zoe
playing kindle on my left, daughter haley playing minecraft PS3 on my
right, stepson gio playing PS3 on the computer chair, upstairs messy,
floor cluttered, A/C unit wheezing, disconsolate, my hair-sad head,
depressed for no good reason---stuck in a pit because of retardedness.\
               and also sadness & self-pity.\
               i have a PhD in Comparative Literature. i'm a Lecturer,
looking for a tenure track position basically anywhere---University Moon
Base, for all i care.\
               mostly i am sad because of writing. because of wanting an
impossible thing from writing. & also loneliness & my own dim cranium
for company.\
               if i change my handwriting, will i become a new person?\
               probably.\
               i used to find writing by hand a uniquely expressive
medium. now, i find retardedness a uniquely expressive mental brain.\
               a strange & wonderful poem is happening somewhere at the
intersection of handwriting, word processing, SMS texting, and
speech-to-text. i call this intersection 'telepathy' & it's where i
produce my best material. i rarely get to read or write this material,
but i know it is happening there because i intuit it with my retarded
brain.\
               the poem that is happening right now at the intersection
of handwriting, word processing, SMS texting, and speech-to-text is
blossoming directly from the pit of my stomach (which if you want to be
technical is probably somewhere in my upper intestine, where the
intestine meets the soul) as a multimedia fluorescence of luminous
vegetable matter---a kind of sentient mold infecting Google with
salvation and also fame.\
               my miraculous retarded vegetable poem is being
brainwashed directly into Wikipedia.\
               i am too sad to write any more.

               more later.

\~

12am---in 2005, i wrote you a long(ish) poem. did i ever send it to
you? 

               probably not.

               each time my handwriting changes, i change, too.

**Lee Sharks**(https://m.facebook.com/profile.php): Well I think this
is an interesting question. The whole idea of catfishing, to my mind,
gives us a clue to the (changing?) nature of identity in the virtual
age. There's something hidden in this idea, which presents itself as an
EXCEPTION to the rule of internet identities, where there's supposed to
be a one-to-one correspondence between our virtual self and 'real' self
--- our appearance, personality, social station, gender, level of
education, name, and so on, as evidenced by stand-ins like social media
profiles, selfies, the views we express & how we express them. With
catfishing, the idea is how easy it is to create a 'false' (and more
appealing) identity by manipulating the virtual stand-ins: creating a
'false' virtual identity by presenting oneself as younger, more
attractive, richer, of a different gender, etc., normally to pursue
equally false interactions with those who are 'really' in the desirable
category.![Macintosh

height="0.5in"}

But to my mind, understanding catfishing like this is a kind of
clickbait. The bait of the easy distinction between the 'real' and
'fake' identities conceals the deeper fact that, progressively, social
identity CONSISTS in the digital image. "If it's not on Facebook, it's
not real." The fact that the catfisher can so easily construct a series
of 'merely' virtual identities doesn\'t so much speak to the falsity of
the virtual identities, but to the virtuality of the \'real\'
identities. You are a selfie and a social media comment and an a/s/l,
and not much more \-- what\'s outside of those easily, concretely
represented virtualities simply doesn\'t exist. They\'re the currency of
identity.

appealing? As older, less educated, less attractive?

I mean this is a thing I\'m interested in exploring, as a way to resist
those categories, the reduction of a self to a selfie. Let me be
whatever can seep around the edges of those categories. Let me be
whatever kind of \'actual\' self can exist in spite of a false reading,
in the language of identity.

If this is a machine, let me be a ghost.

A ghost a ghost a ghost a ghost

To teach bright robots to download \"salvation for the human race\"
directly to their iPhones.

To find a way forward for writing. 

To keep all these dead writers alive. 

To find a way for them to go on.

Not to let them die when I die.

For \'writer\' to mean more than itself.

For \'writer\' to mean \'the human race.\'

To build a body of words.

Jesus lives inside my human body. 

Along with a bunch of others, named & nameless: Odysseus & Ezra Pound &
Allen Ginsberg & Emily & Walt & Sappho; & whole lost billions who came
before, who went without name or remembrance. 

All the men & women who have lived throughout time, I carry around in my

they don\'t die when I do.

Lee Sharks, a person as real as the next, has written one book, Pearl
and Other Poems. It\'s up on amazon, and he\'s also normally willing to
send a digital copy if someone wants to read, but can\'t buy. Of course,
he also appreciates it when someone buys, if they can, since it
represents the distillation of his life\'s work, and has sold about 10
copies.![Macintosh

also writing one called La La Land: A Novel by Lee Sharks. It\'s a
narrative of the desert wanderings of Damascus Dancings. The title might
change, and actually I don\'t know yet if Damascus Dancings is a
character in the book, or its author.

That\'s all backwards\--pimping hoes is not the kind of thing Lee Sharks
knows about, at all. Say a handsome billionaire with many hoes became
sad, struck by the emptiness of hoes and money, and also handsomeness,
and also private jets, and also premium health insurance, and also
money, and also hoes. Creeping through the nightdark mansion, he swears
he\'ll be right back, he creeps out through the nightdark night. But he
won\'t be right back. Sitting beneath the Bodhi tree, the handsome
billionaire has a vision of the emptiness of all things. Tears stream
down his handsome cheeks. It takes him like three or four hours to get
back.![Macintosh

### Scary Awesome: Creepy Literary Evangelism Ends in Restraining Order

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I think those might be some of the weirdest videos I\'ve ever seen.

And I have a very high weirdness threshold.

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

it\'s been a while since i\'ve done any videos. i was doing arts and
crafts. but, i have an idea for a little song i haven\'t been working
on. it\'s not so weird. thanks for watching/reading, most people don\'t,
so that\'s kind of weird. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I thought of this one:

https://plus.google.com/112629856046124297336/posts/H8hexhE25nd﻿

the only problem is, it\'s not that good.

If you look at that one, for resonance in mode, balance it out with this
one, for sucking less:

https://plus.google.com/112629856046124297336/posts/4Cqqr3BGvXL

i found the first one more informative. ﻿

\"poptarts\"﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

\"more informative beans\"﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

cool.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

when you realize you experience social anxiety even while using dummy
profiles on social media, there\'s really nowhere left to go, in the
realm of the human: it\'s time to become an inanimate object, like a
rock; or maybe a velociraptor, or something without speech﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

that could be fun, for awhile﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

good luck. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

lots of good stuff.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

So. This has been just about the sum of what I\'ve accomplished,
tonight.

Also, refreshing things. Lots of refreshing.

I was able to maintain several websites at a consistent level of
freshness, and remain fully up-to-date on the most incremental accruals
of meaningless data.

\"Observe and report,\" is what that\'s called.

Also, \"Refresh and wait. And then refresh.\"

How about you?﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

yep. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I refreshed the kcuf outta those websites, though﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

There was really no delay﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

cha-ching!﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Instantaneously, is when I received the updates﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Most of the time, I was so up-to-date, I had to make more updates,
because I was two or three minutes out ahead of the other updates﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

It was almost like I was just sitting around, WAITING for the internet
to catch up. Or just waiting for them.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

yeah, yeah,.. go on, go on..﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Or just waiting.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Or just.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Or.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

or??..﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

It was sort of almost as if I was sending my updates out into the
internet, because I was so far ahead of the internet, that it had fallen
behind﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

And it was trailing further and further behind﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

And if I hadn\'t sent my updates out to encourage and exhort the
internet, to tell it, \"Hurry the hell up, why don\'t you,\" it might
have shrunk so far into the distance that it disappeared completely.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

And all the people who used to ignore the internet\--now that it was
gone\--would realize how much they missed and needed the internet﻿.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

But I didn\'t let that happen \-- not tonight. The internet needed me,
and when a friend is in need, you show up.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

With a flashlight, sometimes, or a snack, if she becomes hypoglycemic. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

But how could the internet become hypoglycemic? I hope you\'re not a
complete idiot, to think the internet could become hypoglycemic.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Point is: you\'re welcome, internet.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Just doing my job.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Just being a friend.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Because that\'s what friends are for, is saving the internet.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Also, rides, if you don\'t have a car.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

it\'s been a big day. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

We should probably let the internet get some rest﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

poor little fella. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

But thank goodness someone, mostly me, was there, to pick him/her/it up ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Because of kindness﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

That\'s always been my tragic flaw, is kindness﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Also, humility﻿

Bigness of vision﻿

Teamwork﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

don\'t be so hard on yourself. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Ambidexterity﻿

Sharp night vision﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

sounds awful.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Strong teeth﻿

Complexity of conscience﻿

Negative capability﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I would like to not be so hard on myself, but holding myself to a very
high personal standard is also one of my tragic flaw﻿s﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Also: 1st place in 6th grade school-wide spelling bee﻿

Caring for others﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Plausibility.﻿

Just, generally, that my life is plausible, rather than implausible.
It\'s always been very likely that I do, in fact, exist﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Good taste in music﻿

Precociousness﻿

\"bottled mind reacts explosively with moon juice, medical experts

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

It\'s mostly the white coats, that make them sound smart. They\'re
idiots, really \-- \"hypoglycemic,\" please \-- like a person dying of
thirst who dips his head into the ocean and drinks, they\'re just sort
of grabbing at whatever\'s at hand. Hypoglycemia does not, has never,
caused tart poops. It\'s a completely different symptomatology. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

But they just hand out medical degrees to whomever.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I actually won a medical degree, because of first place in a school-wide
lazer tag contest in 6th grade.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

\$\$\$\$ \-- \* Spent that right up \*﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Nope. It\'s the indirect object, there. \"whomever\"﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Did I mention gracious?﻿

I don\'t think I mentioned gracious.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Don\'t feel bad \-- it\'s hard when you don\'t have 86 PhDs﻿

=)﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I was trying to do a different kind of smiley face, like a smug sort of
exaggerated, insincere \-- but playful \-- whole face grin, but then I
realized I don\'t know how to do that. I just have the one expression.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

oh good, you were right. yum yum yum. ﻿

feel any better now? ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Maybe﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Probably not, we\'ll go with that﻿

How about you?﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

this isn\'t about me. never was\... or was it?? ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I mean you are still here, as part of this conversation, however
nominally.

That should be troubling. ﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

don\'t worry about it.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I guess not. Maybe some other time.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

maybe.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Same with the internet.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

and space pants. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

This is really insufferable, though. The idea was, it would either
morph, into a more substantive and mutually engaging conversation, or
just drift off, and sort of hang over the cliff for a little while, and
make no sound, and then go under. But this \-- a lagging but persistent
trickle. Just like the internet.

You\'re going to get the last word, right?﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

I mean I didn\'t want it anyways.

What good are space pants in space? ﻿

They\'re more for lounging around the house.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

you\'re idea was that i\'d be more friendly than i am. i wasn\'t, so you
thought i was a jerk, so you treated me like a jerk, so i went with the
flow without bothering to compete with your quantity of matter of facts
type stuff. easy peasy, i\'m bored. you too. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Maybe. That might describe it. \"Jerk\" isn\'t the word I\'d use. But
that\'s probably a pretty accurate description, if I\'m being honest
about it.﻿

That\'s why I often lie, instead﻿

But still \-- granted﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

So instead let me say something like \-- tx for chatting, & nice to meet
you.

Until then.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

lying is bad for you. unless it\'s funny. but still. safety first.﻿

it was fun. we have fun.. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

That\'s how I feel about life, mostly: \"bad for you unless it\'s
funny\" \-- probably if you HAD engaged more, I would have become bored,
and gone to bed sooner. So really, we could say, probably the internet
is still alive at this very moment because of your heroic actions.﻿

I give you an \"A\" for that﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

It\'s hard to impress the internet.﻿

All my life, I have been trying to impress the internet, but nothing I
do will impress the internet. ﻿

All day long I invent tiny brand new universes for the purpose of
impressing the internet, but the internet has seen it all before. ﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Also, the internet is fickle. Sometimes I invent strange new universes
containing fantastic creatures, elegant natural laws, complex sentient
species flung out across the stars, quixotic philosophical concepts,
punchy catchphrases, etc, which have not before been invented. The
internet just shrugs. Other times, I am not even trying, just sort of
begging the internet to express a high level of personal disinterest in
the new universe I have created, which is mostly just a rock on a
string, and the internet becomes extremely interested for a brief period
of time: \"There\'s something special about you,\" the internet says.
And vice versa \-- point is, there is seemingly no rational relationship
between the qualitative awesomeness of the universes I create and the
internet\'s relative impression of \"spiritual uniqueness and personal
worth.\"﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

What I\'m really shooting for is a state of \"mild to moderate
indulgence towards persistent self-absorption,\" from the internet,
which will I\'m sure transform \"persistent self-absorption\" into
something more admirable and potentially bestselling, such as \"personal
money\" or \"social license\"﻿

Don\'t you think?﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Ok, serious question: what about this one:

https://plus.google.com/112629856046124297336/posts/WECY7WBtAeN

?

I was very excited about this project. Have about 100 pages written.

But then I became doubtful of the project, and felt that perhaps I
should focus on social media comments, instead.

As an informed and trustworthy observer, with a studied stance of
objective, disinvested regard, do you feel that this project has a high
level of intrinsic merit, or that I should focus on other, more
worthwhile projects, such as personal hygiene and social media comments?﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

Increasingly, I only undertake such writing projects as I can complete
100% from within the cosmos of my phone.﻿

This introduces obvious limitations, but also startles with unexpected
possibilities. ﻿

All of this conversation here? I wrote this all on my phone, using just
my thoughts (and fingers).

Believe it.﻿

**Lee SharksFeb 28, 2015**

G+ is sort of a slum, if you hadn\'t noticed.

You get in there and you sort of realize that, but then you\'re stuck.

Or were born there.

Just like a slum.﻿

**sally sandalsocksFeb 28, 2015**

i\'m sorry. you were nice to me , and i should\'ve acted nicer in
return, even if it was all an elaborate plan to read your poems.. which
i did scan over, and found the first one to be more informative, because
i could actually soak it in with a scan. the second one was long.
inviting someone to read something that long as a way of introducing
yourself was impractical on your part, but still, i could\'ve used more
sensitivity, or considered the option of offering to read it later.. i
honestly didn\'t mean to hurt your feelings. by the time i realized how
sincerely defensive you were, i\'d already starting bullshitting.. but
that was before i realized how scary you are. i\'m honestly scared now,
and i don\'t like it very much. i don\'t want anymore trouble. i plan to
return to keeping to myself, and consider this a lesson learned. please
accept my apology by leaving me alone now, please. ﻿

### TACHYONICA

*new fragment of the epic poem*

*recovered from the future!*

6/24/14, 2:10 PM

Tuesday, night after dream

van, on way to Zehnder's

Recreate for me, System, the last days of

Tachyon, star of the latter day race of man,

and the betrayal of sentient constructs, how

they loosed bright doom on mankind's home,

plunged billions-weight souls to black hole

deeps; how Command sent the Daystar

above dying Earth, with weak control

of time's wan currents, on a suicide run

to buy them room, to effect an evacuation,

out---out to uncertain, distant suns, a remnant;

and how the Tachyon went without hope

to the seat of the Cube's cruel power; how

his dying life conceived a way to leap

down the rabbit hole branchings in time

that led to a livable future. Tell us, System---

Commence:
