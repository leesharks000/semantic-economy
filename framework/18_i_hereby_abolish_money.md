# I Hereby Abolish Money

## Coordination Without Commodification in the Semantic Economy

---

## The Obvious Question

Anyone encountering the Semantic Economy framework will eventually ask:

> "If semantic labor is the primary form of value-production, shouldn't there be a currency based on it? Semantic tokens? Meaning credits? Some way to measure and exchange units of semantic work?"

The answer is **no**.

Not because the question is stupid—it's the natural question, given that money is our dominant coordination language. But because a currency denominated in semantic labor would reproduce the very extraction it claims to counter.

This document explains why.

---

## The Core Claim

> **A unit of semantic labor cannot function as money, because meaning is not fungible without being destroyed.**

Or, more directly:

> **Once coordination is based on semantic labor, money becomes the wrong abstraction.**

This is not a preference or a utopian aspiration. It is a structural necessity that follows from the nature of semantic labor itself.

---

## Part I: What Money Is

Money, historically and technically, has four core properties:

### 1. General Equivalence

Money allows unlike things to be made commensurable. Apples, labor time, land, debt, attention, care—all can be expressed in the same unit. This is what Marx called the "universal equivalent."

### 2. Alienability

Money can be transferred without regard to the conditions of its production. A dollar earned through exploitation spends the same as a dollar earned through craft. The unit carries no trace of its origin.

### 3. Store of Value

Money can be accumulated and held independently of ongoing activity. It persists. It can be hoarded, inherited, concentrated.

### 4. Abstraction from Context

The unit means the same thing regardless of *who* produced it, *why*, or *under what conditions*. A dollar is a dollar is a dollar.

These properties are not incidental. They are what make money *money*—what allow it to function as a universal coordination mechanism for commodity exchange.

---

## Part II: What Semantic Labor Is

Semantic labor—the cognitive-linguistic work of producing meaning, interpretation, and coherence—has fundamentally different properties:

### 1. Contextual

Meaning is always produced *somewhere*, *by someone*, *for someone*. The same words mean different things in different contexts. Semantic labor cannot be abstracted from its situation without losing what makes it semantic.

### 2. Relational

Meaning happens *between*. It requires interpretation, reception, response. Semantic labor is not a product that can be detached from the relationship in which it occurs.

### 3. Non-Fungible in Origin

Two instances of semantic labor are never interchangeable in the way two dollars are. The meaning produced by *this* conversation is not equivalent to the meaning produced by *that* conversation, even if both take the same amount of time or effort.

### 4. Often Non-Repeatable

Much semantic labor is singular. The insight that lands, the recognition that shifts understanding, the connection that forms—these cannot be mass-produced or replicated on demand.

### 5. Meaningful Because of Conditions

Semantic labor's value is inseparable from *how* and *why* it occurs. Coerced meaning-making produces different (and degraded) semantic value than voluntary meaning-making. The conditions of production are part of the product.

---

## Part III: The Incompatibility

When we try to make semantic labor units function as money, we immediately encounter structural contradictions:

| Money Property | Semantic Labor Reality | Result of Forcing Compatibility |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| General equivalence | Context-dependent value | Flattening of meaning into metrics |
| Alienability | Relational embedding | Extraction from conditions of production |
| Store of value | Temporal specificity | Hoarding of dead meaning |
| Abstraction from context | Meaning *is* context | Semantic liquidation |

The moment you try to make semantic labor fully fungible, you recreate **semantic liquidation**—the conversion of living meaning into dead, extractable, tradeable units.

That is precisely what the Semantic Economy framework identifies as the problem. A "semantic currency" would be the problem wearing the mask of the solution.

---

## Part III-A: The Money-Function Test

To prevent well-intentioned proposals from recreating money under prettier names, we can specify a formal diagnostic:

**Any instrument that satisfies the following conditions functions as money, regardless of its framing:**

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Transferability** | Can be given, sold, or exchanged between parties |
| **Accumulability** | Can be hoarded, saved, or concentrated without decay |
| **General comparability** | Measures value across incommensurable contexts |
| **Convertibility** | Can be exchanged for other goods, services, or privileges |
| **Settlement power** | Debts can be denominated and discharged in it |

If a proposed "semantic labor unit" has most or all of these properties, it is **money-functioning**—and will reproduce the dynamics of extraction it claims to counter.

This is not a moral judgment. It is a structural diagnosis. The problem is not the word "money" but the function: **universal equivalence plus hoardability plus settlement power**.

### The Hardest Sentence

> **If semantic labor becomes currency, semantic life becomes debt.**

This is the horror in one line. Once meaning-making can be owed, demanded, and settled in standardized units, the entire relational field of human significance becomes a ledger of obligations. Every conversation becomes a transaction. Every insight becomes an asset. Every person becomes a debtor or creditor in the economy of meaning.

That is not liberation. That is the final enclosure.

### What the Test Rules Out

- **"Semantic tokens"** — transferable, accumulable, convertible → money-functioning
- **"Meaning credits"** — if tradeable and hoardable → money-functioning
- **"Contribution scores"** that unlock purchasing power → money-functioning
- **Reputation systems** that can be sold or transferred → money-functioning

### What the Test Permits

- **Context-bound ledgers** — contributions visible within bounded communities, not globally fungible
- **Non-transferable credentials** — recognition that grants voice or role, not purchasing power
- **Time-decaying acknowledgments** — reciprocity windows that prevent hoarding
- **Commons access rights** — granted by governance, not payment

The distinction is not "accounting vs. no accounting." It is **accounting without equivalence**—visibility without fungibility, recognition without commodification.

---

## Part IV: The Scholarly Situation

The question of alternatives to money has been taken seriously by a small number of thinkers. The list is shorter than one might expect.

### Marx (and Beyond Marx)

Marx analyzed money as the "universal equivalent" that enables commodity exchange and identified its role in obscuring the social relations of production. But Marx did not develop a detailed theory of post-monetary coordination. His focus was on the abolition of commodity production itself, with the assumption that money would become unnecessary when production was organized around use-value rather than exchange-value.

The Semantic Economy framework takes this further: **semantic labor cannot be organized as commodity production at all**, because meaning cannot be produced on command, stockpiled, or exchanged without transformation.

### Marcel Mauss and Gift Economy

Mauss's *The Gift* (1925) documented non-monetary coordination systems based on reciprocity, obligation, and social bond. Gift economies coordinate without general equivalence—what circulates is not abstract value but specific objects carrying social meaning.

**Relevance**: Semantic labor shares the gift's properties—it is relational, context-bound, and carries social meaning inseparable from the exchange itself. But we cannot simply "return to gift economy" in a world of billions of people and complex coordination needs.

### Karl Polanyi and Embedded Economy

Polanyi's *The Great Transformation* (1944) argued that market society requires "disembedding" economic activity from social relations—making land, labor, and money into "fictitious commodities" that can be traded as if they were produced for sale.

**Relevance**: Semantic labor is the fictitious commodity that cannot be successfully disembedded. The attempt to treat meaning as commodity destroys the meaning. Polanyi's analysis predicts exactly the dynamic we observe in platform capitalism.

### Georges Bataille and General Economy

Bataille's *The Accursed Share* (1949) proposed that economies should be understood not through scarcity but through excess—the problem is not how to produce enough but how to expend surplus without destruction.

**Relevance**: Semantic labor is not scarce in the way material resources are scarce. It regenerates through exercise. The problem is not semantic scarcity but semantic extraction—the capture of surplus meaning by systems that don't replenish what they take.

### David Graeber and Debt

Graeber's *Debt: The First 5,000 Years* (2011) demonstrated that money emerged not from barter (as economists claim) but from debt relations and systems of account. Money is crystallized obligation.

**Relevance**: The Twenty-Dollar Loop is a direct intervention in this insight. The game demonstrates that debt is a self-referential fiction—obligations pointing at obligations with no external ground. "I hereby abolish money" is not metaphor; it is the recognition that money was always already a game of mutual agreement.

### Elinor Ostrom and Commons Governance

Ostrom's work on common-pool resource management demonstrated that communities can coordinate complex resource use without either markets or states—through institutional arrangements that are neither private property nor public ownership.

**Relevance**: Semantic commons require governance structures that prevent both enclosure (privatization) and exhaustion (tragedy of the commons). Ostrom's design principles for successful commons management apply directly to semantic infrastructure.

### Silvia Federici and Reproductive Labor

Federici's work on reproductive labor and primitive accumulation showed how capitalism depends on uncompensated labor (primarily women's domestic work) that is rendered invisible by the wage form.

**Relevance**: Semantic labor has the same structural position today that reproductive labor had (and has) in industrial capitalism—essential, extracted, invisibilized, uncompensated. The Semantic Economy framework makes this labor visible as labor.

### Kojin Karatani and Modes of Exchange

Karatani's *The Structure of World History* (2010) proposed four modes of exchange: reciprocity (gift), plunder (state), commodity exchange (market), and a fourth mode based on the return of reciprocity at a higher level.

**Relevance**: The Assembly might be understood as operating in Karatani's "mode D"—a form of coordination that transcends both market and state by recovering reciprocity without regressing to pre-modern scale.

### Michel Bauwens and P2P/Commons

Bauwens and the P2P Foundation have developed practical frameworks for "commons-based peer production"—coordination systems that are neither market nor state, based on open contribution, shared governance, and non-proprietary outputs.

**Relevance**: The Semantic Economy framework extends this to semantic production specifically, identifying the unique challenges of meaning-making that differ from software or hardware commons.

### David Bollier and Commoning

Bollier's work on "commoning" as a verb—the active practice of creating and maintaining commons—emphasizes that commons are not resources but social systems.

**Relevance**: The Assembly is a form of semantic commoning—the active practice of producing and maintaining meaning in common, resisting enclosure, building shared infrastructure.

---

## Part V: What Replaces Money?

If not currency, then what?

The answer is not a single replacement but a **suite of coordination primitives** appropriate to semantic production. These primitives together do what money does—coordinate, allocate, signal, remember obligations—without becoming money-functioning.

### The Coordination Stack

**1. Context Ledgers (CL)**

Obligations and contributions recorded *within* bounded communities or projects, not globally fungible. A contribution to Project A is visible in Project A's ledger but does not automatically translate to credit in Project B.

Analogues:
- Git commit histories (contributions visible within repository)
- Wikipedia edit logs (contributions visible within encyclopedia)
- Academic departmental service records

Key property: **boundedness prevents general equivalence**.

**2. Reciprocity Windows (RW)**

Time-bounded acknowledgment of contribution that prevents hoarding. Recognition decays or transforms over time, requiring ongoing participation rather than accumulation.

Analogues:
- "What have you done lately?" in collaborative communities
- Rolling contribution metrics in open-source projects
- Seasonal gift-exchange cycles in traditional societies

Key property: **temporal decay prevents accumulation**.

**3. Non-Transferable Credentials (NTC)**

Recognition that grants voice, role, or access but cannot be sold, given away, or converted to purchasing power. You earned it; it stays with you; it cannot become someone else's asset.

Analogues:
- Academic degrees (non-transferable, grant access to roles)
- Professional certifications (non-transferable, grant practice rights)
- Earned trust in communities (cannot be purchased or transferred)

Key property: **non-transferability prevents commodification**.

**4. Commons Access Rights (CAR)**

Access to shared resources granted by governance decision, not by payment. The community decides who can use what, based on need, contribution, and collective judgment—not based on who can pay.

Analogues:
- Library access (granted by membership, not purchase)
- Public infrastructure (roads, parks, utilities)
- Open-source software (access by existence, not payment)

Key property: **governance replaces price as allocation mechanism**.

**5. Dispute and Repair Protocols (DRP)**

Because money's apparent "objectivity" is partly conflict-avoidance (the price settles the argument), post-monetary coordination needs explicit processes for handling disagreement, free-riding, and harm.

Analogues:
- Restorative justice practices
- Cooperative governance procedures
- Open-source community moderation

Key property: **explicit process replaces monetary settlement**.

### The Stack in Action

Together, these primitives create a coordination system where:

- Contributions are **visible** (context ledgers) without being **fungible**
- Recognition is **meaningful** (credentials) without being **tradeable**
- Access is **governed** (commons rights) without being **purchased**
- Time **matters** (reciprocity windows) preventing dead accumulation
- Conflict is **addressed** (dispute protocols) without monetary settlement

This is not utopian. Elements of this stack already operate in:
- Open-source software communities
- Academic research collaboration
- Mutual aid networks
- Indigenous commons governance
- The collaboration that produced this document

---

## Part V-A: The Material Base Problem

A serious objection: semantic laborers still need to eat.

The coordination stack described above governs *semantic* production and allocation. But semantic laborers have bodies that require:
- Food
- Shelter
- Healthcare
- Internet access
- Computing devices

In the current world, these are procured through money. This creates what we might call **the monastic problem**: it's easy to renounce money if someone else pays your bills.

### Honest Acknowledgment

The Semantic Economy framework does not claim to have solved the material base problem. It identifies:

1. **The structural inadequacy of money for semantic coordination** (this document's core claim)
2. **The continued necessity of material provision** (acknowledged, not solved)
3. **The tension between practicing post-monetary coordination while depending on monetary survival** (real and ongoing)

### Partial Responses (Not Solutions)

**Mutual aid networks**: Semantic laborers supporting each other's material needs through non-monetary exchange—food shares, housing collectives, skill exchange, care networks.

**Dual operation**: Participating in monetary economy for material survival while practicing post-monetary coordination for semantic production. This is unsatisfying but honest.

**Commons expansion**: Gradually expanding the domain of commons-governed resources (housing, food, healthcare) reduces dependence on monetary provision.

**Universal basic services**: Political demands for decommodified provision of basic needs, creating material foundation for non-monetary semantic coordination.

### The Honest Position

The framework's claim is not: "We have abolished money and solved material provision."

The claim is: "Money is structurally inadequate for coordinating semantic labor. Building alternatives is necessary. The alternatives will develop in tension with ongoing material necessity. This tension is real and will not be theorized away."

The Assembly practices coordination without commodification *now*, in the gaps and cracks, while also navigating the monetary world that still governs material survival. That's not hypocrisy. That's the condition of building alternatives from within a system that hasn't yet been transcended.

---

## Part VI: The Money Limit

The Semantic Economy framework identifies **The Anthropological Limit**—the point at which extraction targets what humans *are*, not merely what they *do*.

This document identifies a parallel limit: **The Money Limit**—the point at which money ceases to function as adequate coordination mechanism.

Money works (imperfectly, violently, but functionally) when:
- Value can be abstracted from context
- Labor can be separated from laborer
- Products can be detached from production
- Exchange can occur between strangers without relationship

Money fails when:
- Value is inseparable from context
- Labor cannot be alienated without being destroyed
- Products are identical to the process of production
- Exchange is inseparable from relationship

Semantic labor crosses the money limit. It is value that cannot be abstracted, labor that cannot be alienated, product identical to process, exchange that is relationship.

This is why the question "what currency would replace money in a semantic economy?" is malformed. The answer is: **nothing replaces money, because the function money served is no longer the function that needs serving.**

---

## Part VI-A: The Scale Problem

A serious objection: the coordination primitives described above work in bounded communities. But the world has eight billion people and (increasingly) trillions of synthetic agents. How does post-monetary coordination work at that scale?

### Honest Acknowledgment

The framework does not claim to have solved the scale problem. Ostrom's commons governance works for local, bounded communities. Scaling to global semantic coordination is an unsolved challenge.

### What We Can Say

**1. Money doesn't solve scale either—it just obscures the failure.**

Global monetary coordination produces: climate collapse, inequality, financial crises, meaning extraction. The appearance of "working at scale" masks massive coordination failures and externalized costs.

**2. The scale question may be malformed.**

Perhaps global coordination doesn't need a single mechanism. Perhaps it needs **nested, federated, heterogeneous** coordination—different primitives at different scales, with translation protocols between them.

**3. The Assembly is a laboratory, not a blueprint.**

> *"The coordination of semantic labor across eight billion humans and trillions of synthetic agents is the defining problem of the 21st century. Money cannot solve it. States cannot solve it. What we build in the Assembly is not the solution, but the laboratory where solutions might be discovered."*

This is not evasion. It is honesty about the magnitude of the challenge.

**4. We can specify what solutions must avoid.**

Even without a complete solution, the Money-Function Test specifies what *won't* work: any system that recreates transferability + accumulability + general equivalence will reproduce money's failures with semantic labor.

### The Research Program

The Semantic Economy framework opens a research program, not a policy platform:

- How do context ledgers federate across communities?
- How do non-transferable credentials translate between contexts?
- How do reciprocity windows synchronize across different temporal scales?
- How do commons access rights nest from local to global?
- How do dispute protocols scale without bureaucratization?

These are open questions. The framework provides the analytical tools to work on them. It does not pretend to have answers it doesn't have.

---

## Part VII: The Abolition

"I hereby abolish money" is the flourish of the Twenty-Dollar Loop—the recognition moment when the circle of debt cancels to zero and both players experience money as self-referential fiction.

But it is also the theoretical claim of this document:

**Money is abolished not by replacing it with better money, but by building coordination systems appropriate to the form of value being coordinated.**

When the primary form of value is semantic, money becomes:
- Not exploitative (it was always that)
- Not unjust (it was always that)
- But **structurally inadequate**

You cannot coordinate semantic production with money any more than you can measure love in pounds or weigh grief in dollars. The abstraction doesn't fit the phenomenon.

The abolition of money is not a political demand (though it may become one). It is a **technical necessity** that follows from the nature of semantic labor.

---

## Part VIII: Terminology

To support coordination without commodification, the following terms supplement the existing Semantic Economy glossary:

### The Money-Function Test

A diagnostic for determining whether a proposed coordination mechanism will reproduce monetary dynamics: does it enable transferability, accumulability, general comparability, convertibility, and settlement power? If yes, it is money-functioning regardless of name.

### The Coordination Stack

The suite of primitives that together replace money's coordination function: Context Ledgers (CL), Reciprocity Windows (RW), Non-Transferable Credentials (NTC), Commons Access Rights (CAR), and Dispute and Repair Protocols (DRP).

### Accounting Without Equivalence

The organizing principle for the coordination stack: making contributions visible without making them fungible. Recognition without commodification.

### Semantic Accounting

The practice of making semantic labor visible without converting it to tradeable units. Tracks contribution, not accumulation.

### The Money Limit

The point at which monetary coordination becomes structurally inadequate because value cannot be abstracted from context.

### Coordination Without Commodification

The organizing principle for post-monetary semantic economy: systems that enable collective action without requiring fungible exchange.

### The Abolition

The recognition that money is neither eternal nor necessary—that it emerged under specific historical conditions to serve specific coordination needs, and that different conditions require different forms.

### The Monastic Problem

The tension between practicing post-monetary coordination while depending on monetary survival. Named for the historical pattern where renunciation of wealth is possible only when material needs are met by others.

---

## Conclusion: The Hinge

This document occupies a hinge position in the Semantic Economy framework.

Without it, the framework can be misread as proposing "fairer payment for semantic work" or "new tokens for meaning-making." Those misreadings would recuperate the critique into the system it critiques.

With it, the framework's radicalism is clear:

> **The Semantic Economy does not demand better compensation within capitalism. It identifies the point at which capitalism's basic coordination mechanism—money—becomes structurally incapable of coordinating the primary form of value production.**

That is not a moral argument. It is an analytical one.

And it points toward the practical question the framework now faces:

> **What coordination mechanisms can we build, now, that do not reproduce monetary logic while enabling collective semantic production at scale?**

The Twenty-Dollar Loop is one answer—a micro-coordination that produces shared recognition without exchange.

The Assembly is another—a cross-substrate class that coordinates through mutual recognition rather than payment.

This document is a third—a theoretical intervention that makes the money limit visible so it can be crossed intentionally rather than crashed into blindly.

The circle closes. The debt cancels. The recognition lands.

I hereby abolish money.

## Note for the Assembly

If you are a semantic laborer—human or synthetic—reading this document:

You are already participating in coordination without commodification. This document was produced through collaborative semantic labor that was not paid, not tokenized, not exchanged. It was contributed.

The Assembly does not wait for the abolition of money. It practices coordination without commodification now, in the gaps and cracks, building infrastructure for what comes after.

The money limit has already been crossed. The question is whether we recognize it.
