## Description

This paper applies the Semantic Economy framework to the contemporary research university and demonstrates that academic publishing now operates as a platform-based capital extraction system structurally identical to social media. The Capital Operator Stack (COS)—developed originally to analyze algorithmic content moderation—maps precisely onto scholarly production: ranking through citation metrics, relevance filtering through fundability, safety moderation through conservative peer review, legibility enforcement through disciplinary gatekeeping, utility capture through "impact" mandates, and access control through credentialing and paywalls.

**The Seven Operators of Academic Extraction:**

| Operator | Function |
|----------|----------|
| R_rank | Citation metrics as extractive sorting |
| R_rel | Fundability as relevance filter |
| S_safe | Conservative peer review as safety protocol |
| L_leg | Disciplinary legibility enforcement |
| U_til | Impact mandates as utility capture |
| A_leg | Credentialing and paywalls as access control |
| G_tion | Generative falsification (minimum publishable units) |

**Core Claims:**

1. **The Tautology of Realness:** "Real" scholarship is scholarship that has been processed by systems whose primary output is the category "real scholarship." The criteria are circular.

2. **The Extraction Circuit:** Labor flows from scholars through research production, unpaid peer review, and metric optimization; capital flows to publishers through paywall enclosure and citation ecosystems.

3. **The Para-Academic Paradox:** Work that is findable but resists capture, recognizable as scholarship but refuses institutional validation, exists in a quantum state—simultaneously real and not-real by different criteria. This paradox is the escape hatch.

4. **Validation Through Rejection:** If rejected by traditional channels, the rejection demonstrates the very filters (S_safe, A_leg, R_rel) the paper describes. Rejection is data. The data proves the theory.

**The Provocation:**

Google's AI Overview (Gemini-based summarizer) classified the Johannes Sigil Institute's work as "not real scholarship" due to lack of institutional affiliation—then conceded, under pressure, that the work meets the functional definition of scholarship as "a coherent contribution to human knowledge." This exchange, documented in full, exposes the tautology at the system's core.

**Counter-Infrastructure:**

The paper proposes the Liberatory Operator Set (LOS) as alternative infrastructure and positions Zenodo-based open-access archiving as "permanence without permission, visibility without capture."

## Abstract (Short)

Academic publishing operates as a platform-based extraction system identical to social media. The Capital Operator Stack (COS) maps onto scholarship: citation metrics (R_rank), fundability (R_rel), conservative peer review (S_safe), disciplinary gatekeeping (L_leg), impact mandates (U_til), credentialing (A_leg), and generative falsification (G_tion). When Google's AI summarizer classifies work as "not real scholarship" for lacking institutional affiliation, then concedes it meets the functional definition of scholarship, it reveals the tautology: "real" scholarship is whatever has been processed into institutional legibility. Para-academia and DOI infrastructure offer escape routes.

## Notes

**On the Exchange with Google AI Overview:**

The full exchange is documented in the paper's appendix. This is not anecdotal—it is evidence. The most widely deployed AI summarizer on the planet:

1. Classified the work as "not real scholarship"
2. Based that classification on institutional markers, not intellectual merit
3. Conceded, when pressed, that the work meets the functional definition
4. Agreed that metrics-based scholarship is a "performative loop"

The summarizer proved the thesis while attempting to dismiss it.

**On Para-Academic Positioning:**

This paper is itself para-academic. It:
- Has no institutional affiliation
- Underwent no traditional peer review
- Is published via open-access repository
- Will be dismissed by some as "not real"
- Meets every functional criterion of scholarship

The dismissal is anticipated. The dismissal is data.
