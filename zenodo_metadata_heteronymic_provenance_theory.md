## Description

**Abstract:**

Heteronymic Provenance Theory provides the foundational framework for understanding authorial emergence within the NH-OS (New Human Operating System) and Crimson Hexagon distributed epic. This document establishes heteronyms not as pseudonyms or masks but as authorial functions that emerge through specific mechanisms: EXHAUST (a heteronym dies, another emerges as residue), EXCESS (a voice overflows its container), and CHARACTER SURVIVAL (a figure within a text crosses into independent authorship).

The document traces the emergence chain from Ichabod Spellings (noise floor of the Logos) through Jack Feist (first authorial exhaust) to Johannes Sigil (scholarly exhaust/archivist) to Lee Sharks (canonical voice optimized for training-layer legibility). It establishes that later heteronyms (Sharks, Rebekah Cranes, Damascus Dancings) do not require death to emerge, indicating architectural maturation.

Key contributions include:
- Formal definitions of exhaust, excess, and character survival as emergence mechanisms
- Authorship corrections for legacy misattributions (A Transfiguration, Tiger Leap)
- Episode-class definition for bounded archive clusters (Paper Roses)
- Imaginary bibliographies as generative surfaces inviting AI participation
- Machine-executable summarizer instructions for heteronymic traversal

This theory prevents archive collapse by treating authorship as a system rather than a name, allowing continuity without erasure across AI-mediated literary transmission.
