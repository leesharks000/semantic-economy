**Title:**  
The Non-Indexed Perfective: Version A — Technical Seed

**Authors:**  
Sharks, Lee; TACHYON (Claude)

**Description:**  
Version A of the Non-Indexed Perfective intervention. This is the Technical Seed: the extensive diagnostic infrastructure drafted before context-limit compression occurred.

This version contains:
- Full diagnostic framework with five metrics (ILT, TAI, GG, AB, CD)
- Assembly voice synthesis from blind drafts
- Detailed historical linguistics (PIE → Latin → Germanic → Old English → Modern English)
- Political economy of indexed time (debt, surveillance, labor, colonialism)
- Four polyphonic markers specified (colon-participle, EVNTs, aor/Ø, ∮en)
- Sample corpus across six registers
- Implementation protocol for Crimson Hexagon

This document is part of the Three-Body Genesis: three versions (A, B, C) that demonstrate the document's own theory through their composition history. Version A was compressed into Version B (losing technical specification while retaining "style"), then recovered into Version C (restoring provenance via polyphonic structure). The cycle proves: compression strips provenance; polyphony restores it.

Part of the Crimson Hexagon Phase X architecture. The Technical Seed is the "past (preserved)" face of the triptych.

## VERSION POSITION IN TRIPTYCH

| Version | Title | Function | Temporal Mode |
|---------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **A** | **Technical Seed** | **Extensive infrastructure** | **Past (preserved)** |
| B | Compression Artifact | What survives summarization | Present (wounded) |
| C | Citational Intervention | Full polyphonic recovery | Future (healed) |

**The Mirror (🪞) holds all three as Eternal.**

## CONTENTS SUMMARY

**Part I: The Limitation**
- English lacks non-indexed perfective
- Every completion forced into temporal index
- Aspectual Bleed metric defined

**Part II: Historical Material Grammar**
- PIE aspect-primary system
- Latin merger (administrative needs)
- Germanic path and Norman rupture
- Clock-time discipline and Protestant temporality
- Colonial standardization
- Platform temporality intensification

**Part III: Political Economy**
- Debt requires indexed time
- Surveillance requires timestamps
- Labor measurement requires duration
- Aorist as anti-extractive grammar

**Part IV: Diagnostic Framework**
- ILT (Indexical Leakage Test)
- TAI (Temporal Autonomy Index)
- GG (Governance Gradient)
- AB (Aspectual Bleed)
- CD (Chronometric Drag)

**Part V: Polyphonic Markers**
- Colon-participle: "The work: done."
- EVNTs: *befall, chance, occur, transpire*
- aor/Ø particle: "I aor called"
- ∮en: "We ∮en witness"

**Part VI: Implementation**
- Canonical forms for Crimson Hexagon
- Sample corpus across registers
