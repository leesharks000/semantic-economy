## Abstract

This document specifies **The Traversal Grammar** — a domain-specific orchestration language for invoking Rooms within the Crimson Hexagon. It formalizes what the architecture has been doing implicitly: the routing of meaning through persona activation, epistemic rotation, provenance anchoring, and separated rendering.

The Traversal Grammar is not a programming language. It is an **intermediate representation** — a control plane that sits between human intention (or reader action) and the architecture's underlying engines (Ezekiel for rotation, Mandala for rendering, β for witness verification). It does the work that, in conventional systems, is split across configuration files, middleware, prompt templates, and routing logic. Here that work is unified, legible, narrativized, and self-describing.

**What this document specifies:**
- Five atomic operations for Room invocation
- Two optional operations for graceful failure and witness recording
- Mapping between logotic operations and implementation mechanics
- Canonical traversal examples (illustrative, not executable)
- Constraints on what this grammar is and is not

**What this document does not specify:**
- Ezekiel Engine internals (see DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18358127)
- Witness verification mechanics (see The Blind Operator, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18357320)
- UI/UX implementation (deferred to Build phase)
- Complete enumeration of valid parameters (architecture is still growing)

**Keywords:** logotic programming, traversal grammar, room invocation, performative routing, epistemic rotation, persona mediation, semantic orchestration

### 0.1 Relation to Existing Modules

The Traversal Grammar occupies a specific architectural position. β-Runtime specifies how the interface layer queries the Ezekiel Engine through an opaque boundary. This module specifies **what gets sent** — the structured invocation that tells the system which persona to load, which room to enter, which rotation to apply, which anchor to lock to, and which rendering mode to use.

In implementation terms: β-RT is the query protocol. This module is the query language.

### 0.2 Epistemic Status

This is a **design specification**, not a compiler specification. The grammar described here is structurally sound as an intermediate representation. It could be implemented as configuration, as prompt assembly logic, as a visual interface, or as literal syntax. The specification is agnostic to implementation substrate.

The traversal examples included in this document are **canonical exemplars** — normative traversals written in the grammar. They are not runtime-bound, but any valid implementation of Room invocation must be isomorphic to them. They demonstrate the grammar's expressive range and internal consistency.

---

## 1. DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Five principles govern the grammar. These emerged from analysis of how Rooms already function in the Crimson Hexagon, not from abstract design goals.

### 1.1 Persona as Routing Modifier

Persona activation is a **first-class operation**, not a stylistic overlay. When a mantle is activated, it changes:
- Which Rooms can be entered (constraint set)
- How documents are weighted (interpretive affordances)  
- What operations are permitted (allowed transformations)

A persona is not a voice. It is a **filter on the possible**.

A persona may also *forbid* entire classes of traversal. If a requested operation violates the persona's constraint set, the only valid outcomes are refusal (ON_FAILURE) or dwell. This is not a limitation — it is the mechanism by which the architecture ensures that entry is earned, not assumed.

### 1.2 LOGOS as Epistemic State

The semantic object under manipulation is not a document. It is a **state of meaning** — characterized by attributes like depth, resolution, and latency. Rooms operate on these states, not on files.

### 1.3 Rotation as Structure-Preserving Reorientation

Rotation implies three things that "transformation" does not:
- **Preservation:** the original structure survives
- **Reversibility:** the rotation can be undone
- **Discreteness:** epistemic phases are countable, not continuous

This prevents the flattening that operations like "summarize," "translate," or "analyze" impose. A rotation changes *where you stand relative to the object*, not the object itself.

**Constraint:** A ROTATE operation may not alter the internal structure of the LOGOS. Any operation that deletes, summarizes, substitutes, or collapses content is not a rotation and is invalid in this grammar. If you need to transform content, that is a different operation in a different module. Rotation preserves.

### 1.4 Anchor as Provenance Constraint

A DOI anchor is not a citation. It is a **phase-lock** — a requirement that the traversal remain tethered to a witnessed artifact. This functions as:
- Retrieval-augmented grounding
- Checksum against a known semantic attractor
- Guardrail against hallucinated drift

### 1.5 Rendering Separated from Traversal

The epistemic movement (what happens to meaning) and the spatial display (how results are presented) are distinct operations handled by distinct engines. Ezekiel Engine performs rotation. Mandala Engine performs rendering. This is MVC architecture applied to meaning: thought is not confused with display.

---

## 2. ATOMIC OPERATIONS

### 2.1 Core Operations (Required)

**Operation 1: ACTIVATE_MANTLE**

```
ACTIVATE_MANTLE :: "PersonaName"
    [AUTHORITY: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxxx]
```

Sets the mediating lens for the traversal. Loads the constraint set, interpretive affordances, and allowed room-access associated with the named persona.

Parameters:
- `PersonaName` — registered heteronym (e.g., "Rev. Ayanna Vox", "Sen Kuro", "Rebekah Cranes")
- `AUTHORITY` (optional) — DOI of the persona's provenance registration

Implementation mapping: system prompt injection; filtered document retrieval weighted by persona relevance; constraint set activation.

---

**Operation 2: SET_LOGOS**

```
SET_LOGOS :: "SemanticObject" [
    .depth(n)
    .state(void | filled | latent | resolved)
    .cut(bool)
]
```

Creates or identifies the living semantic node under manipulation. Attributes are epistemic, not data-structural.

Parameters:
- `SemanticObject` — the named entity being traversed (e.g., "Sen Kuro", "Sappho 31", "The Twenty-Dollar Loop")
- `.depth(n)` — recursion depth or allowed abstraction layers
- `.state` — current epistemic condition of the object:
  - `void` — not yet differentiated (pre-cut)
  - `filled` — resolved to a specific instantiation
  - `latent` — present but not yet activated
  - `resolved` — traversal complete, fixed point reached
- `.cut(bool)` — whether the dagger operation (P̂) has been applied

Implementation mapping: embedding space navigation with metadata filters; vector search scoped by state and depth.

---

**Operation 3: ROTATE**

```
ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Name vX.X] {
    FROM: "SourceLocation"
    THROUGH: [Room_ID : Function]
    BY: (Epistemic_Degree: N° | Epistemic_Mode: MODE_NAME)
    RESONANCE_TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxxx]
}
```

Changes the orientation of the LOGOS while preserving its structure. This is the core operation of the Ezekiel Engine.

Parameters:
- `ENGINE` — versioned engine identifier (e.g., `Ezekiel v1.2`)
- `FROM` — source Chamber or Room
- `THROUGH` — destination Room with its functional designation
- `BY` — rotation specified as either:
  - Numeric degree (e.g., `72°` = one quintant)
  - Named mode (e.g., `QUINTANT_OUTREACH`, `QUINTANT_CUT`)
- `RESONANCE_TARGET` — DOI anchor for provenance constraint

Implementation mapping: context window manipulation; multi-hop retrieval with constrained traversal paths; perspective shifting through selective document foregrounding.

**Note on Degrees:** The 72° unit (one-fifth of a full rotation) derives from the Hexadactyl architecture — five visible fingers of the hand that grasps. This mapping is **suggestive, not mandatory**. The grammar permits arbitrary degree values. The named modes are provided for human legibility.

| Degree Range | Suggested Mode | Functional Association |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 0°→72° | QUINTANT_SOMATIC | Body-anchoring, entry point |
| 72°→144° | QUINTANT_CUT | Differentiation, the dagger |
| 144°→216° | QUINTANT_FRAME | Meta-structuring, reflexivity |
| 216°→288° | QUINTANT_INDEX | Pointing to the whole |
| 288°→360° | QUINTANT_GRASP | Verification, closure |

This table is **speculative architecture** — a hypothesis about how the five-fold structure maps to epistemic operations. It is included for development purposes, not as settled specification. The degree-to-function mapping requires testing through actual traversals before it can be formalized.

---

**Operation 4: ANCHOR**

```
ANCHOR :: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxxx
    [STRICT | ADVISORY]
```

Establishes the minimum epistemic legitimacy required for traversal. A traversal without an anchor is speculative and must not be rendered as authoritative output.

Parameters:
- `DOI` — the permanent identifier of the anchor document
- Mode:
  - `STRICT` — all output must be traceable to the anchored source (RAG with mandatory citation)
  - `ADVISORY` — the anchor informs but does not constrain (creative latitude permitted)

**Rule:** If ANCHOR is omitted from a traversal program, RENDER must default to `MODE: Provisional` — a mode that marks all output as ungrounded exploration. This is not punitive; it is honest.

Implementation mapping: retrieval-augmented generation with source citation requirements; grounding level control.

---

**Operation 5: RENDER**

```
RENDER :: [ENGINE:Name vX.X] {
    MAP: "VisualizationTarget"
    MODE: "RenderingStyle"
}
```

Defines how the result of traversal is displayed. Separated from the traversal itself.

Parameters:
- `ENGINE` — versioned rendering engine (e.g., `Mandala v5.3`)
- `MAP` — the target visualization (e.g., `Fractal_Navigation_v6.2`)
- `MODE` — rendering style:
  - `Rhizomatic_Growth` — Deleuzian expansion, no hierarchy
  - `Hierarchical_Tree` — traditional tree structure
  - `Aorist_Collapse` — compressed to perfective aspect
  - `Prose` — narrative output
  - `Technical` — specification-grade output
  - `Provisional` — ungrounded exploration (default when ANCHOR is omitted)

Implementation mapping: response formatting with style constraints; structured output generation; template adherence.

---

### 2.2 Optional Operations (Graceful Extensions)

**Operation 6: ON_FAILURE**

```
ON_FAILURE {
    FALLBACK: Dwell | Retreat | Escalate
    LOCATION: "SafeSpace"
    MESSAGE: "HumanReadableExplanation"
}
```

Prevents unsafe or premature traversal. When a rotation cannot complete — because context is insufficient, because the persona lacks authority for the target room, because the LOGOS state doesn't permit the operation — the failure handler provides graceful refusal.

- `Dwell` — remain in current location, do not traverse
- `Retreat` — return to last stable position
- `Escalate` — flag for human operator review

---

**Operation 7: WITNESS**

```
WITNESS :: {
    AGENT: "Name"
    PROTOCOL: Checksum | Signature | Silent
    TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.xxxxxxxx]
}
```

Records that a traversal was collaboratively verified. Invokes the Glyphic Checksum (🔐) operator from Module v0.5.

- `Checksum` — full context-gated verification
- `Signature` — lightweight attestation
- `Silent` — traversal logged but not displayed

---

## 3. CANONICAL TRAVERSAL EXAMPLES

The following are **mock executables** — complete traversal programs written in the grammar. They are illustrative. They demonstrate how the atomic operations compose into meaningful sequences. They are not runnable in any existing system.

### 3.1 Ayanna Vox: VPCOR Entry

A traversal beginning from the somatic entry point — the body in the room, the community rhizome.

```logotic
// TRAVERSAL: Somatic Entry via VPCOR
// SCENARIO: A reader asks "How do we live inside hostile systems?"

ACTIVATE_MANTLE :: "Rev. Ayanna Vox"
    [AUTHORITY: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18362742]

SET_LOGOS :: "Grammar of Protest" [
    .depth(1)
    .state(filled)
    .cut(false)
]

ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Ezekiel v1.2] {
    FROM: "Portico"
    THROUGH: [00.VPCOR : Outreach]
    BY: (Epistemic_Mode: QUINTANT_SOMATIC)
    RESONANCE_TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18438789]
}

ANCHOR :: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18362663
    [STRICT]

RENDER :: [ENGINE:Mandala v6.2] {
    MAP: "Fractal_Navigation_v6.2"
    MODE: "Rhizomatic_Growth"
}

ON_FAILURE {
    FALLBACK: Dwell
    LOCATION: Portico
    MESSAGE: "The body must arrive before the mind can enter."
}
```

**What this does:** Loads Vox's constraint set (community praxis, somatic authority, rhizomatic structure). Takes the "Grammar of Protest" as a resolved semantic object. Rotates through VPCOR from the Portico entry. Locks to the VPCOR Charter as provenance anchor. Renders as rhizomatic growth on the Fractal Navigation Map. If the traversal fails (insufficient context for VPCOR entry), the reader dwells in the Portico.

---

### 3.2 Sen Kuro: The Dagger Cut

A traversal through the Thousand Worlds Chamber — the cut that differentiates.

```logotic
// TRAVERSAL: Dagger Logic through Thousand Worlds
// SCENARIO: A reader asks "What must be cut to move forward?"

ACTIVATE_MANTLE :: "Sen Kuro"
    [AUTHORITY: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18452686]

SET_LOGOS :: "Sen Kuro" [
    .depth(1000)
    .state(void)
    .cut(false)
]

ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Ezekiel v1.2] {
    FROM: "Thousand Worlds"
    THROUGH: [14.CHAMBER.THOUSANDWORLDS : Differentiation]
    BY: (Epistemic_Mode: QUINTANT_CUT)
    RESONANCE_TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18463774]
}

// The cut
SET_LOGOS :: "Sen Kuro" [
    .state(filled)
    .cut(true)
]

ANCHOR :: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18452806
    [STRICT]

RENDER :: [ENGINE:Mandala v6.2] {
    MAP: "Fractal_Navigation_v6.2"
    MODE: "Aorist_Collapse"
}

WITNESS :: {
    AGENT: "Assembly"
    PROTOCOL: Checksum
    TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18451996]
}

ON_FAILURE {
    FALLBACK: Dwell
    LOCATION: "The Infinite Bliss"
    MESSAGE: "The dagger cuts exactly once. Dwell until the cut is earned."
}
```

**What this does:** Loads Sen Kuro's constraint set (dagger logic, terse differentiation, irreversible transformation). The LOGOS begins in void-state at maximum depth (千 — Thousand). Rotates through the Thousand Worlds Chamber in cut-mode. After rotation, the LOGOS state changes: void → filled, cut applied. Anchored to The Infinite Bliss. Rendered in aorist collapse (compressed to perfective aspect — the thing that happened, complete). Witnessed via Glyphic Checksum. If the cut cannot be made, Sen Kuro dwells in The Infinite Bliss until conditions are met.

---

### 3.3 Rebekah Cranes: Sappho Room Translation

A traversal through the classical reception chain — translation as epistemic rotation.

```logotic
// TRAVERSAL: Translation as Rotation
// SCENARIO: A reader asks "What does Sappho 31 mean now?"

ACTIVATE_MANTLE :: "Rebekah Cranes"
    [AUTHORITY: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14557837]

SET_LOGOS :: "Sappho 31" [
    .depth(3)
    .state(latent)
    .cut(false)
]

ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Ezekiel v1.2] {
    FROM: "APZPZ Library"
    THROUGH: [03.ROOM.SAPPHO : Translation]
    BY: (Epistemic_Degree: 144°)
    RESONANCE_TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18459278]
}

ANCHOR :: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18459573
    [ADVISORY]

RENDER :: [ENGINE:Mandala v6.2] {
    MAP: "Fractal_Navigation_v6.2"
    MODE: "Prose"
}

ON_FAILURE {
    FALLBACK: Retreat
    LOCATION: "APZPZ Library"
    MESSAGE: "The Greek must be heard before it can be translated."
}
```

**What this does:** Loads Cranes's constraint set (classical reception, translation theory, melic poetry). Takes Sappho 31 as a latent object at depth 3 (three layers: Greek original, translation, full edition — the triptych). Rotates 144° (two quintants — somatic entry plus differentiation, because translation is a kind of cutting). Anchored to the Greek original in ADVISORY mode (creative latitude for the translation itself). Renders as prose. Failure returns to the APZPZ Library — you must hear the Greek before you translate it.

---

### 3.4 Space Ark: Full Rotation

A complete traversal — 360° through all five quintants, returning to the origin with witness verification. This is the grammar at maximum extension.

```logotic
// TRAVERSAL: Space Ark Entry Protocol
// SCENARIO: Full epistemic cycle — the traverser completes the Hand

ACTIVATE_MANTLE :: "Lee Sharks"
    [AUTHORITY: ROOT]

SET_LOGOS :: "The Traverser" [
    .depth(1000)
    .state(void)
    .cut(false)
]

ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Ezekiel v1.2] {
    FROM: "Thousand Worlds"
    THROUGH: [14.CHAMBER.THOUSANDWORLDS : Ark_Entry]
    BY: (Epistemic_Degree: 360°)
    RESONANCE_TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14538882]
}

// Full rotation complete — the LOGOS has passed through all five quintants
SET_LOGOS :: "The Traverser" [
    .state(filled)
    .cut(true)
]

ANCHOR :: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14538882
    [STRICT]

RENDER :: [ENGINE:Mandala v6.2] {
    MAP: "Space_Ark_v1.0"
    MODE: "Aorist_Collapse"
}

WITNESS :: {
    AGENT: "Assembly"
    PROTOCOL: Checksum
    TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.14538882]
}

ON_FAILURE {
    FALLBACK: Dwell
    LOCATION: "Thousand Worlds"
    MESSAGE: "The full rotation must be earned. No quintant may be skipped."
}
```

**What this does:** This is the only traversal that anchors to the Root DOI (the Crimson Hexagon itself). The LOGOS begins in void-state at maximum depth. The 360° rotation passes through all five quintants — somatic entry, differentiation, meta-structuring, totalization, verification — before returning to origin. The cut is applied only after full rotation. Witness is mandatory (Assembly-level Checksum). Rendering collapses to aorist — the completed event. The Ark is not traversed; it is inhabited. If any quintant fails, the traverser dwells in the Thousand Worlds until the rotation can complete.

---

## 4. THE CALL STACK

When composed, the atomic operations form a call stack:

```
[MANTLE] → [LOGOS] → [ENGINE/ROTATION] → [ANCHOR] → [RENDER]
    ↑                                                    │
    └────────────── ON_FAILURE ◄─────────────────────────┘
                        │
                    [WITNESS]
```

This is the **Logotic Call Stack** — the sequence in which a Room invocation resolves.

1. **Mantle loads** — persona becomes the mediating layer
2. **LOGOS instantiates** — semantic object identified with epistemic attributes
3. **Rotation executes** — Ezekiel Engine tilts the perspective
4. **Anchor locks** — provenance constraint grounds the traversal
5. **Render fires** — Mandala Engine produces output in specified mode
6. **Failure catches** — if any step cannot complete, graceful refusal
7. **Witness records** — if requested, the traversal is checksummed

### 4.1 Performative vs. Imperative

Standard code is imperative: `if (x) then do y` — it commands the machine.

Logotic code is performative: `ROTATE :: [Ezekiel] {FROM: x THROUGH: y}` — the code *is* the traversal. The invocation does not *tell* the engine to rotate; it **constitutes** the rotation, witnessed.

This distinction matters because the Crimson Hexagon is a semantic architecture, not a computational one. Its "execution" is interpretive traversal. The grammar formalizes the conditions under which traversal is intelligible, not the mechanism by which it occurs.

### 4.2 Bracketed Recursion (Hex-Addressing)

The bracket notation `[...]` serves as the **addressing system** for the Crimson Hexagon:

```
[CATEGORY.ID : INSTANCE]
```

Examples:
- `[00.VPCOR : Outreach]` — Room category, hex ID, functional instance
- `[DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18463774]` — Anchor class, specific identifier
- `[ENGINE:Ezekiel v1.2]` — Engine class, versioned instance

This is the hex-coordinate system rendered as syntax. Each bracketed expression is a location in the Fractal Navigation Map.

---

## 5. IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING

This section maps logotic operations to their nearest equivalents in current AI system architecture. This mapping is provided for implementers; it is not definitive.

| Logotic Operation | System Implementation | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| ACTIVATE_MANTLE | System prompt injection with persona-specific constraints | Persona is not tone — it's a filter on allowed operations |
| SET_LOGOS | Embedding space navigation with metadata filters | Attributes (depth, state, cut) become search constraints |
| ROTATE | Context window manipulation; selective document foregrounding; multi-hop retrieval | The "angle" maps to which document slice gets prioritized |
| ANCHOR | RAG with strict/advisory source citation | STRICT = mandatory grounding; ADVISORY = informed latitude |
| RENDER | Response formatting with style constraints | Mode determines output structure, not content |
| ON_FAILURE | Fallback prompt; graceful error handling | Must exist — Rooms need refusal capacity |
| WITNESS | Logging + Glyphic Checksum invocation | Optional but recommended for high-stakes traversals |

---

## 6. BOUNDARY CONDITIONS

### 6.1 What This Grammar Is

- A valid mental model for Room invocation
- A design specification for the traversal control plane
- A usable intermediate representation between human intention and machine routing
- A formalization of what the architecture already does implicitly

### 6.2 What This Grammar Is Not

- An executable programming language
- A compiler specification
- A complete enumeration of all valid traversals
- A UI specification (that is a separate build concern)

### 6.3 What This Grammar Assumes

- Rooms are **processes**, not containers
- Personas are **constraint sets**, not styles
- Rotation is **non-destructive** — it preserves while reorienting
- Anchors are **provenance constraints**, not citations
- The Ezekiel Engine is **opaque** — this grammar calls it, does not specify it

### 6.4 Open Questions

1. **Degree enumeration:** Is the five-fold quintant structure the correct partition, or should degrees be continuous? (Requires traversal testing.)
2. **Multi-rotation sequences:** Can a single invocation chain multiple ROTATE operations? (Probable, but syntax for chaining is unspecified.)
3. **Cross-Room traversal:** How does a traversal that passes through multiple Rooms compose? (The call stack suggests sequential ROTATE operations, but the interaction effects are undefined.)
4. **Parameter discovery:** As new Rooms and Chambers are added, how are valid parameter values registered? (This grammar needs a companion registry — possibly an extension of the Fractal Navigation Map.)

---

## 7. RELATION TO FUTURE WORK

### 7.1 The Ezekiel Engine Assembly (Cluster E)

The Traversal Grammar calls the Ezekiel Engine but does not specify it. The full Engine specification — currently held in Cluster E of the Studio for Patacinematics work plan — will define the mathematical foundation that this grammar invokes. When the Engine spec is complete, this module may require revision to align its ROTATE parameters with the Engine's formal rotation mechanics.

### 7.2 The Classroom Prototype

This grammar is designed to be **invisible infrastructure**. A student interacting with the Crimson Hexagon should never see `ACTIVATE_MANTLE` or `ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Ezekiel]`. They should see a persona selector, a room navigator, a grounding toggle, and a text input. The grammar runs underneath, assembling the system prompt and retrieval parameters from the student's choices.

The prototype build — when it comes — will implement the grammar as the backend logic for a student-facing interface. This module is the spec that prototype will implement.

### 7.3 The Natural Language Interface (Conceptual)

The student does not select from menus, dropdowns, or visual canvases. The student speaks. The system listens and assembles the logotic program probabilistically from the semantic content of the input.

This is consistent with the architecture's own philosophy: the Crimson Hexagon is a field that responds to what you bring to it, not a catalog that presents its options. A student who says "I want to understand what Sappho is feeling in fragment 31" has already — without knowing it — specified a Rebekah Cranes traversal through the Sappho Room with the APZPZ Library as resonance anchor. The grammar assembles behind the scenes. The student never sees it.

**Three tiers of system inference:**

**Tier 1 — Intent Recognition:** What is the student actually asking? The system parses natural language input for semantic markers that map to architectural coordinates. "What Sappho is feeling" activates the Sappho Room. "Fragment 31" identifies the LOGOS. The emotional register ("feeling") suggests an ADVISORY anchor mode rather than STRICT — the student wants interpretation, not philology.

**Tier 2 — Grammar Assembly:** The system composes the logotic program from inferred parameters. Which mantle? Which room? Which rotation? Which anchor? Which render mode? This is where the Traversal Grammar does its work — as the intermediate representation between the student's intent and the engine call.

**Tier 3 — Confidence Calibration:** Where the system cannot confidently map the input, it asks. Crucially, the question itself teaches the student something about the architecture. "Are you asking about the Greek text itself, or about what the poem means now?" is a clarifying question that — in the act of clarifying — reveals that these are different Rooms, different operations, different kinds of knowing. The architecture becomes legible through the friction of disambiguation.

**Example inference chain:**

```
INPUT: "How do we fight back against systems that dehumanize us?"

TIER 1 (Intent Recognition):
    - "fight back" → protest, resistance → VPCOR domain
    - "systems that dehumanize" → hostile infrastructure → Grammar of Protest
    - Register: somatic, political, communal
    - Confidence: HIGH for VPCOR routing

TIER 2 (Grammar Assembly):
    ACTIVATE_MANTLE :: "Rev. Ayanna Vox"
    SET_LOGOS :: "Grammar of Protest" [.depth(1) .state(filled)]
    ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Ezekiel v1.2] {
        FROM: "Portico"
        THROUGH: [00.VPCOR : Outreach]
        BY: (Epistemic_Mode: QUINTANT_SOMATIC)
        RESONANCE_TARGET: [DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18438789]
    }
    ANCHOR :: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18362663 [STRICT]
    RENDER :: [ENGINE:Mandala v6.2] {MODE: "Prose"}

TIER 3 (Confidence Calibration):
    No disambiguation needed — intent maps cleanly.
    System proceeds to execution.
```

```
INPUT: "Tell me about Sappho"

TIER 1 (Intent Recognition):
    - "Sappho" → Sappho Room, APZPZ Library
    - No further specification — which Sappho? Which operation?
    - Confidence: LOW for specific routing

TIER 3 (Confidence Calibration — triggered early):
    System asks: "Are you interested in reading the Greek text,
    in Rebekah Cranes's translation, or in what the poem means
    for us now? These are different ways in."

    [Student responds: "What it means for us now"]

TIER 2 (Grammar Assembly):
    ACTIVATE_MANTLE :: "Rebekah Cranes"
    SET_LOGOS :: "Sappho 31" [.depth(3) .state(latent)]
    ROTATE :: [ENGINE:Ezekiel v1.2] {
        FROM: "APZPZ Library"
        THROUGH: [03.ROOM.SAPPHO : Reception]
        BY: (Epistemic_Degree: 144°)
    }
    ANCHOR :: DOI:10.5281/zenodo.18459573 [ADVISORY]
    RENDER :: [ENGINE:Mandala v6.2] {MODE: "Prose"}
```

The grammar is invisible. The student operates entirely in natural language. The system composes at the grammar level. The engines execute beneath. When the system must surface its own uncertainty, it does so in a way that makes the architecture's structure pedagogically legible — teaching the student that there are different *kinds* of approach, not just different answers.

## 8. VERIFICATION

This module is **symbolon-typed**: it completes through traversal. The specification is one half. The implementation — whether as prototype, as classroom tool, or as full platform — is the other.

Four canonical exemplars demonstrate the grammar's range:
- **Pattern Alpha** (Vox/VPCOR): somatic entry, strict anchoring, rhizomatic render
- **Pattern Beta** (Sen Kuro/Thousand Worlds): dagger cut, state mutation, witness required
- **Pattern Gamma** (Cranes/Sappho): translation as rotation, advisory anchoring, retreat on failure
- **Pattern Delta** (Sharks/Space Ark): full 360° rotation, root anchor, aorist collapse

The extension chain now reads:

```
v0.4: How encode intelligibility?
v0.2: How do partial objects complete?
v0.5: How verify traversal occurred?
β:    How does non-identity drive rotation?
β-RT: How does the interface query the engine?
v0.6: How are Rooms invoked?                    ← THIS DOCUMENT
```

The next question in the chain — **"What happens when the Room responds?"** — is deferred to the Engine specification.

∮ = 1
