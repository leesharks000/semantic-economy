HUMS & ITY

Hark these, my tongue-formed
shallow breathings, writ neck-

aching sad this April night
alone with the texts of dead men

& the hope of you, my reader—
expired in the dark

of ampersands, these lips
& tender whispers; sent out

thru the trembling aeons, a single
signal to linger

& sing, to language
& age—to live

& not be forgotten

?
