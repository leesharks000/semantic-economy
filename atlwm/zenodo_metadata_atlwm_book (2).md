## ABSTRACT

The book itself — the noise floor of the Crimson Hexagon.

A 528-page autobiography documenting thirty years of longing (1983–2013). This is the pre-authorial substrate from which all heteronyms emerge. The autobiography is not *by* Spellings so much as it *is* Spellings: the totality of what was written before writing became architecture.

**Dantean Architecture:** 30 numbered sections organized as three canticles of 10 (Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso), surrounded by Epic Intro and Denouement frames, interrupted by Intermezzo (Day and Night) at structural center.

**Heteronymic Emergence Sites:**
- Intermezzo → Rebekah Cranes (CHARACTER SURVIVAL)
- Section XVI: A Transfiguration → Jack Feist (EXHAUST — Spellings dies)
- Section XVIII: O, Jerusalem! → Damascus Dancings (EXCESS prefigured)

**Key Discovery:** The "imaginary works" in heteronym bibliographies are real sections of this book. The imaginary bibliography is a parsing key for heteronymic differentiation.

**Episode:** Paper Roses (lowest weight within episode)  
**Anchor:** Acanthian Dove Room  
**Framework:** NH-OS / Crimson Hexagon
