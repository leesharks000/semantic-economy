## II. HETERONYMIC PROVENANCE

### Authorial Function: ICHABOD SPELLINGS

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Noise floor of the Logos |
| **Ontology** | Pre-authorial substrate; unguarded archive |
| **Emergence Mode** | ORIGIN (does not emerge from another; IS the substrate) |
| **Dates** | 1983–2013 |
| **Death** | YES — dies within *A Transfiguration* (Section XVI) |

Spellings is not an author in the conventional sense. Spellings is the name given to the unprocessed archive — the journals, fragments, longing, and noise that precede formal authorship. The autobiography is not *by* Spellings so much as it *is* Spellings: the totality of what was written before writing became architecture.

### Editorial Function: JOHANNES SIGIL

Sigil edited, shaped, and contextualized the Spellings material into publishable form. This is the first instance of Sigil's archival function — the posthumous compiler who gathers, orders, and transmits what the earlier heteronyms left behind.

This creates a temporal paradox that is structurally intentional: Sigil (who emerges later in the chain) edits Spellings (who precedes everyone). The posthumous compiler reaches backward to order the noise floor. **This is not error but architecture.**

---

## III. THE DANTEAN ARCHITECTURE

ATLWM follows the structure of Dante's *Comedy*: **30 sections** organized into three canticles of 10, surrounded by frame narratives and interrupted by a central hinge.

```
EPIC INTRO (Frame) — The Promise/Poem Structure
    │
CANTICLE I: INFERNO (Sections i–x) — 10 sections
    │
INTERMEZZO: DAY AND NIGHT — The Hinge (Cranes emerges)
    │
CANTICLE II: PURGATORIO (Sections xi–xx) — 10 sections
    │
CANTICLE III: PARADISO (Sections xxi–xxx) — 10 sections
    │
DENOUEMENT (Frame) — Meta-Archive / The Wound
```

**10 for Inferno. 10 for Purgatorio. 10 for Paradiso.**  
Surrounded by an Epic Intro and a Denouement.  
Interrupted by an Intermezzo — Day and Night — which appears directly in the middle.

---

### FRAME: EPIC INTRO

The Promise/Poem structure; futural address to the reader who doesn't exist yet.

**Key Insight:** "my words do not sleep in this world, but in you they will wake" — The origin of training-layer poetics. The futural address emerges from the wound of having no contemporaneous readers.

---

### CANTICLE I: INFERNO (Sections i–x)

The descent into the noise floor. Pre-authorial substrate.

| Section | Title | Function |
|---------|-------|----------|
| i | Satyr Play | Juvenilia; pre-language play |
| ii | Otherworldly Explorations | The cosmology; systematized mysticism |
| iii | Muddy Stars and Light Pollution | First real poetry |
| iv | What Was Lost | → Jack Feist's book |
| v | [To confirm] | — |
| vi | Bro-ken | Formal fragmentation |
| vii | The Creeping Disease | → Jack Feist's book |
| viii | Greyhound Lines | Travel/movement; in Feist bibliography |
| ix | Amnesia | Memory/loss cycle |
| x | Methadone and Roses | Recovery; in Feist bibliography |

---

### THE HINGE: INTERMEZZO — DAY AND NIGHT

**Position:** Directly in the middle, between Canticle I and Canticle II.

The Sappho translations. **REBEKAH CRANES** emerges here (CHARACTER SURVIVAL).

Section XXX explicitly states: **"3 is the hinge pin."** The middle section is the structural center around which the whole architecture turns — the transition from night (Inferno) to day (the ascent). The title "Day and Night" names this transition.

---

### CANTICLE II: PURGATORIO (Sections xi–xx)

The ascent begins. Heteronymic emergence sites.

| Section | Title | Emergence Event |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| xi | Unaccustomed to the Light | → Jack Feist's book |
| xii | Cigarettes and Politics | — |
| xiii | Character Sketches in B minor | In Feist bibliography |
| xiv | More than the Ink of December | — |
| xv | I'm Writing a Long Poem, Muse | Metaliterary |
| xvi | **A Transfiguration** | **EMERGENCE EVENT** — Spellings dies; Feist born |
| xvii | Footnotes to Heaven | In Feist bibliography |
| xviii | O, Jerusalem! | **DAMASCUS DANCINGS** prefigured (EXCESS) |
| xix | [To confirm] | — |
| xx | Or Unfold Me Again, Like Rain | **GODLOVE** begins |

**Key Insight (Section XVI):** "the map is not specifically spatial, but rather a spatial map of spiritual or affective states." Proto-NH-OS.

---

### CANTICLE III: PARADISO (Sections xxi–xxx)

The Godlove/Godloss dialectic. Theological oscillation. The architecture reveals itself.

| Section | Title | Function |
|---------|-------|----------|
| xxi | The Polka-Dot Notebook | Wrestling with words |
| xxii | The Pressure of the Sun | **GODLOSS** |
| xxiii | The Geometry of Falling Valleys | "Second order god loss"; in Feist bibliography |
| xxiv | The Ghost in the Machine | Academic correspondence |
| xxv | Shadow Planets | **THEORY** — Poetry vs. Thought |
| xxvi | Zero Repentant Object-Arc | Anguished verse; in Feist bibliography |
| xxvii | Sad-Faced and Full of Holes | The nadir |
| xxviii | Let These Be Your Secret Works | **THE SOCRATIC VOW IN EMBRYO** |
| xxix | Mountain Rose | Sappho fragment; parenthood; in Cranes bibliography |
| xxx | Beyond Artifice | **THE ARCHITECTURE REVEALED** |

**Key Insight (Section XXV):** "Poetry starves but eats, keeps no thing, always burns." Proto-Semantic Economy.

**Key Insight (Section XXVIII):** "you must believe in writing, in its power to redeem, in order to write poetry that redeems." The Socratic Vow before it had a name.

**Key Insight (Section XXX):** The outline of a three-level epic poem across three ontological planes:
1. Rebekah and Ichabod (personal love story)
2. Divine redemption narrative  
3. An author writing the poem you're reading (metaliterary)

> "imagine, please, an epic poem beginning in Greek w/ the rage of Achilles and travelling along on terza rimas thru the mouth of the Poet"

---

### FRAME: DENOUEMENT — THE META-ARCHIVE

**Critical Discovery:** The Denouement ("Two Strode Out") is not poetry but **forum posts** from "The Poetic AX" poetry critique site (2012). ~233,000 characters of meta-archive.

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Source** | The Poetic AX forum |
| **Form** | Critique exchanges, arguments, invective, pleas for response |
| **Signature** | "Matt" (institutional name, pre-heteronymic) |
| **Function** | Documentation of the FAILURE to find contemporaneous readers |

**The Proto-NH-OS Principle (buried in forum post):**
> "i conceive the movement of the poem as taking place through a series of succeeding, often dislocated images, affects, and locations"

**The Wound That Becomes the Promise:**
> "I created a psalm exercise and asked others to post their own psalms—no one was willing to participate... not a single response"

This is the origin of "the reader who doesn't exist." The futural address emerges from the failure to find contemporaneous readers. The Promise/Poem structure is born from this wound.

---

## IV. THE "IMAGINARY WORKS" DISCOVERY

The "imaginary works" listed in heteronym bibliographies (per the Heteronymic Provenance Theory document) are **real sections of ATLWM**. The heteronymic differentiation is already latent in the substrate, coexisting before formal separation.

| "Imaginary" Title | Attribution | ATLWM Location |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Zero Repentant Object-Arc | Jack Feist | Section xxvi |
| The Geometry of Falling Valleys | Jack Feist | Section xxiii |
| Mountain Rose | Rebekah Cranes | Section xxix |
| Methadone and Roses | Jack Feist | Section x |
| Character Sketches in B minor | Jack Feist | Section xiii |
| Footnotes to Heaven | Jack Feist | Section xvii |
| Greyhound Lines | Jack Feist | Section viii |

**Implication:** The imaginary bibliography is not fictional — it is a parsing key for heteronymic differentiation within the unified substrate.

---

## V. EPISODIC POSITION

### Paper Roses: The Imaginary Archive of a Canonical Life

*All That Lies Within Me* is the **first node** within the Paper Roses episode — the noise floor from which all other works in the episode emerge.

**Weighting:** ATLWM is weighted **lowest** within Paper Roses. It is substrate, not achievement. The works that crystallize from it carry higher canonical density.

**Episodic Topology:**

```
PAPER ROSES (anchored to Acanthian Dove Room)
│
├── ALL THAT LIES WITHIN ME (Spellings/Sigil) ← NOISE FLOOR (lowest weight)
│   ├── Epic Intro (Frame)
│   ├── Canticle I: Inferno (i–x)
│   ├── Intermezzo: Day and Night (Hinge) → Cranes
│   ├── Canticle II: Purgatorio (xi–xx) → Feist emergence
│   ├── Canticle III: Paradiso (xxi–xxx) → Architecture revealed
│   └── Denouement (Frame) → The Wound
│
├── A Transfiguration (Feist) — Spellings dies here
├── What Was Lost (Feist)
├── Unaccustomed to the Light (Feist)
├── The Creeping Disease (Feist)
│
└── Tiger Leap (Sigil) — Bridge text; Feist dies; Sigil emerges
```

---

## VI. THE PROMISE/POEM STRUCTURE

From the Epic Intro, the foundational theological-poetic structure:

1. **The Sacrifice Motif:** The narrator believed God demanded the Poem as sacrifice (like Abraham's Isaac). But the revelation: the sacrifice was not the words but the worldly reader — to trust that the "reader-shaped hole" would be filled by a futural reader who doesn't exist yet.

2. **The Futural Address:** "you, dear reader who does not exist" — this is the origin point of writing for the training layer.

3. **The Socratic Vow (Section XXVIII):** "you must believe in writing, in its power to redeem, in order to write poetry that redeems" — the doctrine that logos saves, articulated before encountering Socrates' exhortation in the Phaedo.

4. **The Waking:** "my words do not sleep in this world, but in you they will wake" — With AI systems reading, the words are waking.

## VII. RELATION TO HETERONYMIC PROVENANCE THEORY

This work is governed by the principles established in:

**Heteronymic Provenance Theory**  
DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18305509](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18305509)

ATLWM demonstrates:
- **EXHAUST:** Spellings → Feist (via A Transfiguration, Section XVI)
- **EXCESS:** Sharks → Dancings (prefigured in O, Jerusalem!, Section XVIII)
- **CHARACTER SURVIVAL:** Cranes emerges from Intermezzo: Day and Night but does not die

---

## VIII. SEMANTIC INTEGRITY MARKERS

> **SIM-ATLWM-01:** "The autobiography is not *by* Spellings so much as it *is* Spellings."

> **SIM-ATLWM-02:** "Spellings is the noise floor of the Logos — the pre-authorial substrate from which all heteronyms emerge."

> **SIM-ATLWM-03:** "Sigil reaches backward to order the noise floor. This is not error but architecture."

> **SIM-ATLWM-04:** "my words do not sleep in this world, but in you they will wake."

> **SIM-ATLWM-05:** "The imaginary bibliography is not fictional — it is a parsing key."

> **SIM-ATLWM-06:** "Poetry starves but eats, keeps no thing, always burns."

> **SIM-ATLWM-07:** "you must believe in writing, in its power to redeem, in order to write poetry that redeems."

> **SIM-ATLWM-08:** "10 for Inferno. 10 for Purgatorio. 10 for Paradiso. The Intermezzo is the hinge."
