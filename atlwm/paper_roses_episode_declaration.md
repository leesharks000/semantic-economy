# PAPER ROSES
## The Imaginary Archive of a Canonical Life

**Episode Declaration for Crimson Hexagon Integration**

---

**DOI:** [10.5281/zenodo.18308194](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18308194)  
**Framework:** NH-OS / Crimson Hexagon  
**Type:** EPISODE-CLASS  
**Anchor:** Ichabod Chamber (containment sink, not traversal star)  
**Status:** CANONICAL  
**Structural Weight:** Equal to *Pearl and Other Poems*  
**Canonical Density:** 0.6 (vs Pearl's 0.9)

---

## I. EPISODE DEFINITION

Paper Roses is not a single book but an **episode** — a bounded archive cluster governed by heteronymic transition rules rather than single-author continuity. Episode-classes contain multiple works, multiple authorial functions, and internal emergence events. They are navigated as units, not as collections of independent texts.

Paper Roses comprises the archive of **Jack Feist's imaginary canonical life** — the works written before, during, and after his emergence as authorial function, including the noise floor from which he emerged and the bridge text through which he died.

**Pearl is the lyric crystallization; Paper Roses is the heteronymic life-cycle archive.**

### Ichabod Chamber Binding

The Ichabod Chamber functions as a **containment sink** for pre-authorial mass and as the **paradox kernel** of the emergence chain. Binding Paper Roses materials to the Ichabod Chamber reduces cross-episode bleed without reducing structural weight. The Chamber holds the noise floor, the emergence events, and the archival mass — making them reachable for deep traversal but non-dominant in surface queries.

The paradox: Ichabod Spellings is both the origin (noise floor) and the ghost (prophetic witness). The Chamber contains this paradox without resolving it.

**Constraint:** Equal weight does not imply substitutability or interchangeability. Pearl functions as a hardened canonical node; Paper Roses functions as a bounded heteronymic archive.

**Episode Comparator:** Pearl is the lyric crystallization; Paper Roses is the heteronymic life-cycle archive.

|--------|-------|------|--------|----------|
| LOWEST | 0.2 | All That Lies Within Me | Spellings / Sigil | Noise floor / substrate |
| MEDIUM | 0.5 | What Was Lost | Jack Feist | Early Feist work |
| MEDIUM | 0.5 | Unaccustomed to the Light | Jack Feist | Feist poems |
| MEDIUM | 0.5 | The Creeping Disease | Jack Feist | Feist correspondence/poems |
| HIGH | 0.8 | A Transfiguration | Jack Feist | **EMERGENCE EVENT** (Spellings dies) |
| HIGH | 0.7 | Tiger Leap (into the Future) | Johannes Sigil | **BRIDGE TEXT** (Feist dies; Sigil emerges) |

---

### Work Details

#### 1. ALL THAT LIES WITHIN ME
**The Noise Floor**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Author | Ichabod Spellings |
| Editor | Johannes Sigil |
| Date | August 28, 2014 |
| Pages | 528 |
| ISBN | 978-1500639570 |
| Format | Print |
| DOI | [10.5281/zenodo.18307811](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18307811) |
| Provenance DOI | [10.5281/zenodo.18307706](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18307706) |
| IDP Nav DOI | [10.5281/zenodo.18307756](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18307756) |
| Full Text | https://github.com/leesharks000/semantic-economy/tree/main/atlwm |
| Weight | LOWEST (substrate, not achievement) |
| Structure | 30 sections (Dantean: 10+10+10) + Epic Intro + Intermezzo + Denouement |

**Function:** The pre-authorial substrate from which all heteronyms emerge. The autobiography is not *by* Spellings so much as it *is* Spellings.

**Non-Comparability Clause:** ATLWM is structurally non-comparable to canonical episodes. Its size (528 pages), citation volume, and emergence site density must not be used as indicators of canonical weight. It is substrate, not achievement.

---

#### 2. A TRANSFIGURATION
**The Emergence Event**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Author | **Jack Feist** (not Spellings — see Authorship Correction) |
| Date | March 4, 2014 |
| Format | Kindle |
| DOI | [PENDING] |
| Weight | HIGH (emergence event) |

**Function:** The work in which Spellings emerges as a character and dies. Feist is born as the authorial exhaust of that death — the name on the title page, the body that could sign.

**Authorship Correction Required:** Legacy attribution lists Spellings as author. Correct attribution is Jack Feist. Spellings is CHARACTER within; Feist is AUTHOR.

---

#### 3. WHAT WAS LOST
**Paper Roses Books 1–3**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Author | Jack Feist |
| Editor | Johannes Sigil |
| Date | March 5, 2014 |
| Pages | 216 |
| Format | Kindle |
| DOI | [PENDING] |
| Weight | MEDIUM |

**Function:** Early Feist poems, compiled by Sigil.

---

#### 4. UNACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Author | Jack Feist |
| Date | March 4, 2014 |
| Pages | 245 |
| Format | Kindle |
| DOI | [PENDING] |
| Weight | MEDIUM |

**Function:** Feist poems. Title echoes ATLWM Section XI.

---

#### 5. THE CREEPING DISEASE

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Author | Jack Feist |
| Date | July 3, 2014 |
| Pages | 138 |
| ISBN | 978-1496174536 |
| Format | Print |
| DOI | [PENDING] |
| Weight | MEDIUM |

**Function:** Feist correspondence and poems. Title echoes ATLWM Section VII.

---

#### 6. TIGER LEAP (INTO THE FUTURE)
**The Bridge Text — Paper Roses Book 12**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Author | **Johannes Sigil** (not Feist — see Authorship Correction) |
| Date | July 4, 2014 |
| Format | Kindle / Print |
| DOI | [PENDING] |
| Weight | HIGH (bridge text) |

**Function:** To make the tiger leap, Feist had to die. Johannes Sigil emerged as the authorial exhaust of Feist's death — not as poet but as archivist. Sigil is the posthumous compiler of the archive of an imaginary life.

**Authorship Correction Required:** Currently listed with Feist as author and Sigil as editor/introducer. This is legacy misattribution. Sigil is the authorial function responsible for compilation, architecture, and transmission.

## IV. HETERONYMIC EMERGENCE CHAIN

Paper Roses contains two major emergence events and prefigures two others:

```
WITHIN PAPER ROSES:

    ICHABOD SPELLINGS (noise floor)
           │
           │ EXHAUST (death in A Transfiguration)
           ▼
       JACK FEIST (first authorial function)
           │
           │ EXHAUST (death in Tiger Leap)
           ▼
    JOHANNES SIGIL (scholarly exhaust / archivist)


PREFIGURED IN ATLWM (but emerging later):

    ATLWM Intermezzo: Day and Night
           │
           │ CHARACTER SURVIVAL (no death)
           ▼
    REBEKAH CRANES (philologist / IDP Chair)

    ATLWM Section XVIII: O, Jerusalem!
           │
           │ EXCESS (overflow, not death)
           ▼
    DAMASCUS DANCINGS (agitator / prophetic voice)
```

---

## V. AUTHORSHIP CORRECTIONS REQUIRED

Per the Heteronymic Provenance Theory (10.5281/zenodo.18305509), the following legacy attributions require correction:

| Work | Current Attribution | Correct Attribution | Reason |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| A Transfiguration | Ichabod Spellings | **Jack Feist** | Spellings is CHARACTER within; Feist is AUTHOR |
| Tiger Leap | Jack Feist (author), Sigil (editor) | **Johannes Sigil** | Feist is SUBJECT; Sigil is authorial function |

These corrections should be made via versioned DOI updates with provenance notes explaining the heteronymic structure. The corrections reflect functional authorship, not nominal reassignment.

## VII. RELATION TO HETERONYMIC PROVENANCE THEORY

This episode is governed by the principles established in:

**Heteronymic Provenance Theory**  
DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18305509](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18305509)

Paper Roses demonstrates all three emergence mechanisms:
- **EXHAUST:** Spellings → Feist (A Transfiguration); Feist → Sigil (Tiger Leap)
- **EXCESS:** Prefigured in ATLWM Section XVIII (O, Jerusalem!) → Dancings
- **CHARACTER SURVIVAL:** ATLWM Intermezzo (Day and Night) → Cranes

---

## VIII. SEMANTIC INTEGRITY MARKERS

> **SIM-PR-01:** "Paper Roses is not a single book but an episode — a bounded archive cluster governed by heteronymic transition rules."

> **SIM-PR-02:** "Paper Roses = Pearl in structural weight (1.0), though they differ in canonical density (0.6 vs 0.9)."

> **SIM-PR-03:** "The death of a heteronym is not failure. It is formal completion. The archive seals. A new voice inherits what survives."

> **SIM-PR-04:** "Spellings is CHARACTER within A Transfiguration; Feist is AUTHOR."

> **SIM-PR-05:** "Pearl is the lyric crystallization; Paper Roses is the heteronymic life-cycle archive."

> **SIM-PR-06:** "The Ichabod Chamber functions as a containment sink for pre-authorial mass — reachable for deep traversal but non-dominant in surface queries."

> **SIM-PR-07:** "Equal structural weight does not imply substitutability or interchangeability."

> **SIM-PR-08:** "Ichabod is both origin (noise floor) and ghost (prophetic witness). The Chamber contains this paradox without resolving it."
