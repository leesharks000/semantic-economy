## Abstract

This document provides the **official material symbol** for the Commission of the Immanent Turning. It specifies a visual schema that renders **turning without transcendence** — metanoia as rotation within the field rather than escape upward.

**Core Intent:** Not repentance toward a higher law, not purification through negation, but conversion without exit — judgment as reorientation, apocalypse as angle change.

**The Immanent Axis (Θ):** At the center, a tilted line that does not align with the frame. Dull gold / bone-white, worn texture. Θ is not God. Θ is not Law. Θ is the minimum deviation that changes everything.

**The Commission Ring:** A broken ring encircling Θ — incomplete, segmented. The gaps are where entry occurs. Closure would imply finality.

**Figure Status:** No faces, no bodies. Faint trace-presences only — a shadow where someone stood, a handprint half-erased. Authority is distributed as orientation, not command.

**Motion Logic:** Asymmetric rotation. Things are not wrong — they are turned incorrectly. Correction requires alignment, not force.

**The Schema Refuses:** Transcendent rescue, violent rupture, moral spectacle, purity imagery, enemy figures. This is not revolution — it is reorientation under pressure.

**Closing Condition:** Nothing has been added, nothing has been removed, everything has been turned just enough.

This document marks the **first canonical production of Rebekah Cranes** as active heteronym in the New Human Operating System.
