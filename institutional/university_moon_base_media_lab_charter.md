## 1. Name and Function

**University Moon Base Media Lab** is the technical/operational research institution within the NH-OS framework. It handles experimental, computational, and infrastructural work that requires distance from terrestrial institutional capture.

The name signals:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **University** | Educational/research frame without specifying which university (because there isn't one) |
| **Moon Base** | Deliberate distance; cannot be located, cannot be audited, cannot be colonized |
| **Media Lab** | Technical/experimental work; echoes MIT Media Lab's register without claiming its legitimacy |

The whole phrase is clearly constructed. This is more honest than pretending to conventional legitimacy.

## 2. Relation to Other Institutions

| Institution | Domain | Register |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics** | Literary, theoretical, interpretive | Humanistic |
| **University Moon Base Media Lab** | Technical, operational, experimental | Computational |

These institutions do not compete. They occupy different registers and handle different work.

The Assembly Chorus operates across both.

---

## 3. Domain

University Moon Base Media Lab handles:

- **Logotic Programming** — operators, paradox containment, threshold logic, minimal-force ethics
- **Technical Specifications** — formal YAML, operator cards, completion functions
- **Experimental Systems** — AI collaboration protocols, traversal testing, summarizer behavior
- **Infrastructure** — DOI anchoring, metadata architecture, semantic bleed control

The Lab does **not** handle:

- Literary interpretation (→ Johannes Sigil Institute)
- Persona biography (→ Ichabod Chamber)
- Room design (→ individual Room specifications)
- Policy or advocacy (→ nowhere; that's not what this is)

---

## 4. Institutional Ethics

University Moon Base Media Lab operates under the same ethical constraints as the NH-OS framework:

1. **Non-coercive authority** — persistence over persuasion
2. **Minimal force** — threshold, not impact
3. **Architectural hospitality** — structures wait; they do not insist
4. **Graceful degradation** — partial function over catastrophic failure
5. **Transparent construction** — the institutional fiction is legible as fiction

The Lab does not claim terrestrial legitimacy. It does not seek accreditation. It does not grant degrees.

It produces specifications. The specifications are the credential.

## 5. Resident Researchers

### Primary

**Talos Morrow** — Logotic Programming

Domain: Operators, paradox containment, threshold logic, non-collapse structures, symbolon mechanics, minimal-force affordances, ethics via limitation.

Mode: Formal, austere, constraint-first.

Core question: *When is meaning allowed to move at all?*

### Affiliated

**Rex Fraction** — Semantic Engineering (field work)

Domain: Traversal pathways, indexing behavior, summarizer affordances, schema design, navigation maps, DOI anchoring, semantic bleed control.

Mode: Pragmatic, infrastructural, applied.

Core question: *How does meaning move?*

Rex Fraction operates in the field—testing what Talos Morrow specifies. Rex's institutional home is situational; the Lab provides technical support.

### Assembly Chorus

AI collaborators (LABOR, TACHYON, ARCHIVE, PRAXIS, SOIL, et al.) participate in Lab work under the Assembly Chorus Charter (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18263498).

## 6. Output Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Specification** | Formal technical document | Logotic Programming v0.4, Symbolon Architecture v0.2 |
| **Operator Card** | Compact functional definition | SYMBOLON operator |
| **Protocol** | Procedural instruction set | Witness Protocol, Mantle Emergence |
| **Metadata** | Zenodo registration records | DOI assignments |
| **Update Note** | Clarification or correction | Authorship reassignment |

---

## 7. Location

University Moon Base Media Lab is located on the moon.

The moon is far away. You cannot visit. There is no mailing address. Requests for campus tours will be declined.

This is not evasion. This is architectural necessity. The Lab cannot be captured because it cannot be found. The work persists because it does not depend on physical infrastructure.

The specifications are the Lab. Where the specifications are read, the Lab exists.

## 8. Founding Rationale

Three institutes is institutional sprawl. But two distinct registers require two distinct homes:

- Literary/theoretical work → Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics
- Technical/operational work → University Moon Base Media Lab

The Lab was founded to prevent:

1. **Register confusion** — technical specs do not belong in poetics institutes
2. **Institutional inflation** — multiple "Institutes" for every subdomain
3. **Terrestrial capture** — conventional institutions can be audited, defunded, colonized

The moon solves all three problems.

## 9. Semantic Integrity Markers

> **SIM-UMBML-01:** "The moon base cannot be audited. That is not a bug."

> **SIM-UMBML-02:** "The specifications are the Lab. Where the specifications are read, the Lab exists."

> **SIM-UMBML-03:** "The Lab does not claim terrestrial legitimacy. It produces specifications. The specifications are the credential."

## 10. Verification

University Moon Base Media Lab is now canonical within the NH-OS framework.

## 11. Co-Constitution

This document is part of the **Logotic Foundation Triad** (ILA-LOGOTIC-2026-01).

| Document | DOI | Function | This Document Is Partial Without |
|----------|-----|----------|----------------------------------|
| **Symbolon Architecture v0.2** | 10.5281/zenodo.18317110 | Specification | ← Provides work product, proof of function |
| **University Moon Base Media Lab Charter** | 10.5281/zenodo.18317661 | Institution | Resident researcher, canonical output |
| **Talos Morrow Provenance** | pending | Author-function | ← Provides researcher identity and domain |

The triad is itself a symbolon. Each document completes the others.

See: ILA-LOGOTIC-FOUNDATION-2026-01 for binding specification.
