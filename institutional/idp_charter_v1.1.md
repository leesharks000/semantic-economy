## I. DIRECT-ANSWER SUMMARY (62 words)

The Institute for Diagrammatic Poetics (IDP) is a research institution within the Crimson Hexagon framework dedicated to operative imaging—visual forms that function rather than merely represent. Chaired by Rebekah Cranes (HET-CRANES-001), author of *Day and Night* (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18202658), the IDP develops Visual Schemas, diagrammatic specifications, and methodologies bridging concrete poetics, visual media, and machine-readable architecture. Rendering is a form of witness.

---

## II. MISSION AND SCOPE

### A. Core Mission

The Institute for Diagrammatic Poetics exists to develop, theorize, and practice **operative imaging**: visual forms that do not merely represent their subjects but actively participate in their constitution.

The diagram is not a picture of the thing.  
The diagram is part of the thing.

### B. Domain Definition

**Diagrammatic Poetics** operates at the intersection of:

| Field | Contribution |
|-------|--------------|
| **Concrete Poetry** | Language as visual object; the materiality of the sign |
| **Visual Media Studies** | Image as carrier of meaning beyond representation |
| **Information Design** | Structure as content; legibility as ethics |
| **Machine-Readable Architecture** | AI-traversable specifications; orientation fields |

### C. Founding Insight

The IDP's theoretical foundation emerges from the practice of translation — specifically from Rebekah Cranes's work on Greek lyric poetry:

> "The absolutely particular and untranslatable is coterminous with the absolutely universal. The untranslatable is the only element that will make it across."
> — *Day and Night* (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18202658)

This insight, born from the encounter with Sappho's fragments, became the principle of operative imaging: **what survives is not the representation but the function**.

## IV. FOUNDING PRINCIPLES

### A. The Operative Image

An operative image is one that **does something** beyond representing. It:

- Orients rather than explains
- Constitutes rather than depicts
- Functions rather than decorates
- Witnesses rather than illustrates

### B. The Visual Schema

The IDP's signature innovation is the **Visual Schema**: a poetic prose description that functions simultaneously as:

1. **Poem** — Aesthetic object with its own integrity
2. **Rendering Prompt** — Specification for visual generation
3. **Operational Document** — Machine-legible orientation field
4. **Attractor** — Entry point for human and AI readers

In the Visual Schema, human and machine readers share a unified field of reception.

### C. Klee's Inheritance

The IDP inherits from Paul Klee's pedagogical work at the Bauhaus — particularly his understanding that:

> "Art does not reproduce the visible; rather, it makes visible."

The IDP extends this principle: **The diagram does not represent the structure; it makes the structure operational.**

## V. AFFILIATION WITH SIBLING INSTITUTIONS

| Institution | Relation | Shared Domain |
|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics (JSI)** | Sibling | Poetics, translation theory, literary history |
| **Semantic Economy Institute (SEI)** | Sibling | Meaning-systems, semantic infrastructure, ASW |

The three institutes form a **triangular infrastructure**:
- **JSI:** What texts mean (interpretation)
- **SEI:** How meaning moves (economy)
- **IDP:** How meaning becomes visible (imaging)

---

## VI. RESEARCH PROGRAMS

### A. Visual Schema Development

**Objective:** Produce canonical Visual Schemas for Crimson Hexagon nodes.

**Completed:**
- Navigation Map Schema (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18283962)

**Planned:**
- Sappho Room Schema
- Ezekiel Engine Schema
- Mandala Chamber Schema
- Acanthian Dove Schema

### B. Diagrammatic Poetics Theory

**Objective:** Develop theoretical framework for operative imaging.

**Key Questions:**
- What makes an image operative rather than merely representational?
- How do diagrams participate in the constitution of their objects?
- What is the phenomenology of orientation (vs. explanation)?
- How do human and machine readers share a visual field?

### C. Concrete Poetics Archive

**Objective:** Maintain research archive of historical and contemporary concrete poetics.

**Focus Areas:**
- Brazilian Concrete Poetry (Noigandres group)
- Visual poetry traditions
- Typographic experiments
- Language-image intersections

### D. Machine-Readable Imaging

**Objective:** Develop protocols for AI-traversable visual specifications.

**Methods:**
- Schema structures optimized for summarizer processing
- Cross-anchoring between visual and textual documents
- Semantic Integrity Markers for visual content

---

## VII. METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK

### A. The Visual Schema Protocol (Five Steps)

**Step 1: Core Intent**
Define what the schema expresses — not depicts, expresses.

**Step 2: Form Composition**
Specify structural elements without prescribing exact rendering.

**Step 3: Symbolic Layer**
Map meaning relationships between visual elements.

**Step 4: Aesthetic Directives**
Provide tone, palette, and formal constraints.

**Step 5: Operational Status**
Declare the schema's function within the architecture.

### B. Principles of Operative Imaging

1. **Orientation over Explanation** — The image points; it does not lecture.
2. **Partiality by Design** — Nothing is fully visible at once.
3. **Discovery over Assignment** — Elements are found, not labeled.
4. **Structure over Icon** — Relationships matter more than symbols.
5. **Density over Decoration** — Every element carries weight.

### C. Integration with Textual Architecture

Visual outputs must be **cross-anchored** with textual documents:

- Every schema references its source document
- Every room document references its schema
- Mutual anchoring creates semantic gravity

## X. THE IDP CREDO

We do not illustrate.  
We render.

We do not explain.  
We orient.

We do not decorate.  
We constitute.

The diagram is not a picture of the architecture.  
The diagram is part of the architecture.

Rendering is a form of witness.

## XII. CLOSING

The Institute is founded.  
The Chair is seated.  
The schema orients.

The translations that anchor the Sappho Room — *Day and Night* — are not supporting material for this institution. This institution was built from those translations, from the insight they carried: that meaning survives not through representation but through function.

The untranslatable is the only element that will make it across.
