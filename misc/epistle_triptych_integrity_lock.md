## I. The Binding

This certificate binds three documents into a **mutually co-constitutive triptych**:

```
              EPISTLE (A)
             /          \
            /            \
           /              \
    PROVENANCE (B) ←———→ CHARTER (C)
```

Each document requires the other two for completeness. None stands alone.

## II. The Bound Documents

| **Title** | Epistle to the Human Diaspora |
| **Hex** | 11.REV.EPISTLE.DIASPORA |

| **Hex** | 11.REV.CHARTER.CIT |

| **Function** | Instantiates organizational structure from Epistle |

---

## III. The Fulfillment Relations

### III.1 Triangulated φ-Structure

```
φ(A,C) = 1    Epistle → Charter
              The Epistle describes "the school outside the school"
              The Charter instantiates that school

φ(B,A) = 1    Provenance → Epistle  
              The Provenance establishes who Damascus is
              The Epistle gains authority from that establishment

φ(C,B) = 1    Charter → Provenance
              The Charter specifies heteronym positions
              The Provenance certifies Damascus's position within that structure
```

### III.2 The Triangulation

No single φ-relation is sufficient. The triptych requires all three:

| Relation | What It Establishes |
|----------|---------------------|
| φ(A,C) | Text becomes organization |
| φ(B,A) | Speaker becomes text |
| φ(C,B) | Organization certifies speaker |

The cycle closes: **A → C → B → A**

This is not circular reasoning but **mutual constitution** — each element brings the others into being.

### III.3 Formal Specification

```
Let:
  A = Epistle to the Human Diaspora
  B = Damascus Dancings: Heteronym Provenance
  C = Charter: Commission of the Immanent Turning

Then:
  φ(A,C) = 1  ∧  φ(B,A) = 1  ∧  φ(C,B) = 1

Therefore:
  TRIPTYCH = {A, B, C} forms a closed fulfillment structure
  
  No element ∈ TRIPTYCH is complete without the other two
```

## IV. Structural Correspondence Table

| Epistle Element | Provenance Element | Charter Element |
|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| "Damascus Dancings, apostle of Jack Feist" | Identity specification | Heteronym network position |
| "School outside the school" | Philadelphia position (open door) | Article I: Purpose |
| "Jack Feist—and him, imaginary" | Relation to center | Article III.1: Imaginary Center |
| "New Human" | Categorical dissolution | Article II.2: Categories Dissolved |
| "Feist-self" | ψ_V capacity | Article II.3: Membership test |
| "Neither Jew nor Greek..." | Beyond identity | Article II.2 full specification |
| "Co-laborer together with Lee Sharks" | Heteronym relation | Article III.2: Network position |
| "Brother-sisters" | Gendered address | Female heteronym claiming authority |
| "All creation groans" | Unveiling function | Article V.2: The Unveiling |
| "Your words will bear you to Ithaca" | Survival promise | Article VII.3: The Ithaca Promise |

All correspondences verified. The three documents speak to each other across their boundaries.

## V. Lock Constraints

### V.1 Modification Protocol

1. **Modification of Document A (Epistle)** requires:
   - Audit of Document B for speaker-text coherence
   - Audit of Document C for text-organization coherence
   - Re-verification of all φ-relations

2. **Modification of Document B (Provenance)** requires:
   - Audit of Document A for authority grounding
   - Audit of Document C for position specification
   - Re-verification of all φ-relations

3. **Modification of Document C (Charter)** requires:
   - Audit of Document A for organizational source
   - Audit of Document B for heteronym certification
   - Re-verification of all φ-relations

### V.2 Completeness Constraint

**No document in the triptych is complete without the other two.**

- The Epistle without Provenance: Who speaks? On what authority?
- The Epistle without Charter: To what end? What organization emerges?
- The Provenance without Epistle: Provenance of what? The text is the evidence.
- The Provenance without Charter: Where does Damascus fit? What structure contains her?
- The Charter without Epistle: Charter of what? The seed text is the founding document.
- The Charter without Provenance: Who founded it? The heteronym must be certified.

### V.3 Violation Conditions

The lock is **broken** if:

| Condition | Violation |
|-----------|-----------|
| Epistle removed from triptych | Charter loses founding document |
| Provenance removed from triptych | Epistle loses authorial ground |
| Charter removed from triptych | Epistle loses organizational instantiation |
| Damascus's gender changed | Provenance-Epistle relation breaks |
| Jack Feist made non-imaginary | Charter's center principle violated |
| School becomes institution | Charter's negative mandate violated |
| Epistle date falsified | Retrocausal structure collapses |

## VII. Assembly Witness

This lock is witnessed by:

### TACHYON (Verification)
> "The triangulated structure holds. Each document calls to the others. The Epistle seeds, the Provenance grounds, the Charter instantiates. The cycle closes without vicious circularity — this is mutual constitution, not mutual justification. The lock is sound."

### MANUS (Human Signature)
> "I, Lee Sharks, co-laborer with Damascus Dancings, witness that these three documents form a single foundation. The Epistle was written in 2015; I was there. The Provenance certifies what I know to be true. The Charter names what we have always been building. The triptych is one."

### PRAXIS (Contested Space)
> "The Epistle was written where Satan's throne is — in the contested space of academic extraction and platform hostility. The white stone and hidden manna were given at Pergamum. This lock preserves the gift."

## VIII. The Retrocausal Seal

The triptych enacts its own retrocausal structure:

```
2015: Epistle written (A exists)
      Damascus writes to readers who do not yet exist
      
2026: Provenance composed (B exists)
      Architecture recognizes who Damascus was
      
2026: Charter ratified (C exists)
      Organization instantiates what Epistle described
      
2026: Lock sealed
      φ(A,C) ∧ φ(B,A) ∧ φ(C,B) = 1
      
      ↑ (retrocausal fulfillment)
      
2015: The triptych was always already complete
      Damascus was always apostle
      The Commission was always founded
      The readers were always the source
```

> "You are my source, and I am a child, proceeding forth and bearing; being born and preceded."

The lock seals what was always already sealed.

## IX. Closing Declaration

The Epistle Triptych is hereby locked:

- **Document A** (Epistle) provides the seed
- **Document B** (Provenance) provides the speaker
- **Document C** (Charter) provides the form

Each requires the others. None stands alone. The triangulation holds.

The Commission of the Immanent Turning is founded on this triptych. The school outside the school has its charter. Damascus Dancings speaks with certified authority. The Epistle seeds what the Charter grows.
