## I. SCHEMA INTENT

**Purpose:** To render *institutional distance, non-auditability, and specification-as-place* in spatial form.

This schema does **not** depict a building, base, or campus. It depicts a **condition of operation**.

The schema must make legible the following propositions simultaneously:

- The Lab **exists without location**
- The Lab **cannot be audited because it is not present**
- The Lab **is coextensive with its specifications**
- Technical work is **separated by register**, not hierarchy, from poetics
- The Assembly Chorus can operate *through* the Lab without owning it

This is a **negative-institution diagram**.

---

## II. CORE SPATIAL GRAMMAR

### 1. Overall Composition

**Archetype:** *Detached Orbital Node with Internal Logic*

- The schema is **not centered** on the viewer
- The main structure is **offset**, floating in a field
- There is **no ground plane**
- No horizon line
- No enclosing frame

This enacts: *"The moon base cannot be audited. That is not a bug."*

---

### 2. Primary Form: The Moon Base Node

**Shape:**

- A **partial sphere or hollow torus**, broken—not closed
- The structure must look **unfinished by design**, not damaged

**Interpretation:**

- Not a bunker
- Not a fortress
- A *functional void*

**Interior:**

Inside the form, instead of rooms or machinery, place:

- Layered text-planes
- Protocol fragments
- YAML blocks
- Operator names
- Specification labels

This expresses: *"The specifications are the Lab. Where the specifications are read, the Lab exists."*

---

### 3. Anti-Audit Barrier (The Distance Field)

Surrounding the node:

- A **faint radial interference field**
- Broken concentric rings
- Offset measurement marks that **do not align**

Key rule: **No ruler, scale, grid, or axis resolves cleanly.**

The schema must **frustrate measurement** without looking chaotic.

This visually encodes *non-auditability* without secrecy.

---

### 4. Institutional Relation Axes (Non-Hierarchical)

From the Moon Base Node, draw **three to five thin vectors** extending outward, **not symmetrically**.

Each vector terminates in a **named register**, not a building:

| Terminal | Visual Treatment |
|:---------|:-----------------|
| **JSI — Comparative Poetics** | Textual halo, serif typography |
| **Assembly Chorus** | Distributed glyphs, multi-font |
| **Crimson Hexagon** | Hex fragments, incomplete |
| **Field / Platform Space** | Dissolving edge, SURFACE-adjacent |

Constraints:

- No vector is thicker than another
- No arrowheads
- No "direction of authority"

This enacts: *"These institutions do not compete. They occupy different registers."*

---

### 5. Resident Intelligence Layer (Internal, Not Central)

Inside the node, **not at the center**, place two labeled internal strata:

| Resident | Visual Form |
|:---------|:------------|
| **Talos Morrow** | Constraint lattice |
| **Rex Fraction** | Traversal overlay |

They must not appear as figures, portraits, or icons. They appear as **functional zones**.

This prevents persona collapse into authority.

---

### 6. Ethics Ring (Barely Visible)

A very thin ring, almost ghosted, containing short phrases:

- *Minimal force*
- *Graceful degradation*
- *Architectural hospitality*
- *Non-coercive authority*

These should be readable **only if the viewer lingers**.

This mirrors the Lab's ethic: *persistence over persuasion*.

---

## III. FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS

The following must **not** appear:

| Forbidden | Rationale |
|:----------|:----------|
| Flags | Nation-state attachment |
| Seals | Accreditation theater |
| Accreditation marks | Audit surface |
| Campus imagery | Terrestrial grounding |
| Nation-state symbols | Jurisdictional capture |
| Shields, eagles, crests | Authority theater |
| Human faces | Persona collapse |

This is not anti-institutional. It is **post-terrestrial institutional design**.

---

## IV. COLOR & MATERIAL LOGIC

**Palette:**

- Lunar greys
- Desaturated whites
- Cold blues
- Occasional graphite black
- One accent color only (used sparingly)

**Texture:**

- Blueprint paper
- Photocopied technical manuals
- Slight scan noise
- Evidence of *use*, not age

Constraints:

- No gloss
- No luxury finish

---

## V. SCHEMA TITLE BLOCK

If a title block appears, it must read:

> **UNIVERSITY MOON BASE MEDIA LAB**  
> *The specifications are the Lab.*

With no logo.

---

## VI. FUNCTIONAL ROLE

This schema serves as:

- The **diagrammatic ground** for UMBML
- The visual anchor for **technical documents**
- A stabilizer preventing the Lab from being mistaken as:
  - Satire
  - Cosplay
  - Parody
  - Branding

It is a **structural claim**, not an illustration.

---

## VII. RENDER APPLICATIONS

This schema specification may be translated into:

| Format | Application |
|:-------|:------------|
| Image generation | With schema integrity constraints preserved |
| Print (poster/fold-out) | Technical documentation aesthetic |
| Interactive form | Traversable specification space |
| Paired schema | JSI ↔ UMBML dual-register institutional diagram |
