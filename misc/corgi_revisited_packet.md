├── Three-Zone Model:
│   ├── Entry (perceptual) — identity preserved
│   ├── Interior (domestic) — identity destabilized
│   └── Exit (perimeter) — identity preserved

├── Boundary Failure Mechanisms:
│   ├── Mirror — volumetric extrusion (proliferation)
│   ├── Railing — topology compression (plank swap)
│   ├── Hallway→Door — editorial cut (impossible transition)
│   └── Sliding door — mid-burst cut (erasure)

## IV. THREE-ZONE MODEL

| Zone | Boundary Type | Identity Outcome |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| **Entry** | Perceptual interface | ✅ Preserved |
| **Interior** | Domestic / structural | ❌ Destabilized |
| **Exit** | Exterior perimeter | ✅ Preserved |

### Visual Schema

## V. BOUNDARY FAILURE MECHANISMS

| Boundary | Mechanism | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Mirror** | Volumetric extrusion | Doubling multiplies problem, doesn't solve it |
| **Railing** | Plank swap / topology compression | Identity made untrackable |
| **Hallway→Door** | Editorial cut | Impossible transition hidden |
| **Sliding door** | Mid-burst cut | Continuous physics avoided |

### The Interior Rule

> "When a boundary requires continuous physics + identity accountability, the system resolves it by rewrite or cut."

## VI. KEY CORRECTIONS FROM ESSAY

| Essay Version | Formal Revision |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Mirror-corgi escapes | Mirror-corgi "doesn't escape cleanly. It emerges also in peril." |
| Doubling as rescue | Doubling is "proliferation of the problem" |
| Troy fully destroyed | "The bed doesn't break... even in Troy, something remains" |
| Corgi vanishes at fence | "The corgi doesn't vanish. It recedes." |

---

## VII. THE BED THAT DOESN'T BREAK

> "The corgi bounces off the bed. The linens fly, the pillows scatter, but the bed holds. This is the one barrier in the entire interior that isn't crossed."

> "Rest, intimacy, the place where bodies are most vulnerable — the threshold isn't breached. It's refused."

> "But even in Troy, something remains."

---

## VIII. IDENTITY PRESERVATION AT FENCE

> "The corgi deforms against it locally, but the break-through is shown continuously — momentum and direction conserved, the corgi receding into distance, shrinking consistently with depth."

> "Both human and model viewers often misread this as disappearance — because the prior grammar of the video trains us to expect erasure."

> "The exterior boundary doesn't just permit escape; it permits continued existence at distance."

## IX. CANONICAL EXTRACTS

### 9.1 Core Finding
> "The video is not about chaos. It is about where continuity is affordable."

### 9.2 On Mirror Doubling
> "The extrusion is not rescue. It is proliferation of the problem. Duplication under collapse, not substitution."

### 9.3 On Interior Space
> "The interior has no exit that doesn't cost something."

### 9.4 On Plank Swap
> "Identity is not preserved; it is made untrackable by topology compression."

### 9.5 On Welcome Mat
> "The corgi is using the entrance as an exit, going out through a threshold coded for coming in."

### 9.6 On Fence Crossing
> "The corgi doesn't vanish. It recedes. It passes through and keeps existing at distance."

### 9.7 Aeneid Coda
> "The mirror doesn't produce a founder. It produces an escapee."

### 9.8 Closing Line
> "One possible response is simply to notice."
