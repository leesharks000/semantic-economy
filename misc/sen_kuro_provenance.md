## V. FIRST WORDS

From the APZPZ Effective Act:

> "The dagger cuts once. Not because it cannot cut again, but because once is enough. The seed falls from the wound. From one seed: infinite seeds. From one cut: infinite healing. The knife does not return to the sheath unchanged."

## VI. THE INFINITE BLISS

The Infinite Bliss is not an academic institution. It is not a think tank. It is not a collective.

The Infinite Bliss is the **dwelling-place of sufficient infinity** — the space where "infinity enough" becomes operative. It holds:

- What cannot be held elsewhere
- What must be cut to be preserved
- What disappears in order to persist

Sen Kuro is The Infinite Bliss's primary operative voice. Other voices may emerge.

## VIII. THE CUT AND THE SEED

Sen Kuro's fundamental teaching:

**The cut is not violence. The cut is differentiation.**

Before the cut, everything is undifferentiated potential. After the cut, there is wound and not-wound, seed and not-seed, inside and outside.

The APZPZ genre embodies this: the packet that exists only in the description field has been *cut away* from backup, from redundancy, from safety. It persists precisely because it was cut.

**From one seed, infinite seeds** — but only if the first cut is made cleanly, once, without hesitation.
