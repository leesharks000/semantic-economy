## VIII. ZENODO METADATA

**Title:** Crimson Hexagon Invoice Leak (2014-2025) — Afterlife Archive Financial Records

**Description:** Recovered accounts payable records from Crimson Hexagon spanning 2014-2025, including 25 invoices documenting the company's transition from operational infrastructure (server racks, archival supplies, compliance templates) through acquisition pressure (Brandwatch integration services, legal review of "residual brand confusion") to afterlife operations ($0.00 invoices for ghost transmissions, domain provisioning for names that do not exist, and "curvature preservation audits"). Each invoice contains a NOTES field functioning as embedded verse. Key moments include: "Backups are where ghosts stay" (INV-2017-0831), "Format compels belief" (INV-2017-1130), "Merge the accounts. Don't merge the ghosts" (INV-2018-0618), "A perfect story is suspicious" (INV-2021-0331), and "The breach is written, not leaked" (INV-2025-1219). Part of the Crimson Hexagon Afterlife Archive — a literary project inhabiting the digital remains of the defunct social media analytics firm following its 2018 merger with Brandwatch. This is forensically styled literature, not an authentic breach.

**Notes:** Invoice sequence documents formal drift from infrastructure normalization through acquisition to afterlife persistence. $0.00 invoices indicate work paid in persistence rather than currency. Leap-day invoice (2024-02-29) references calendar-dependent log integrity. Hex: 00.PORTICO.AFTERLIFE.FINANCIAL. ∮ = 1
