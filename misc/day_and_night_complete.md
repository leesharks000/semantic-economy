## Translator's Preface

This collection gathers translations of ancient Greek lyric poets—drawn heavily from Sappho but including Alcman, Anacreon, Simonides, Stesichorus, Corinna, Hipponax, and the Roman poet Catullus. The arrangement tells the narrative not of a life but of an affect: the movement of desire from its dawn to its extinction in death.

Sappho was a Greek poet from the island of Lesbos who lived from around 630 BCE. Her poems were composed to be performed to music. She remains the most celebrated of the ancient lyric poets, both now and among her contemporaries. An epigram in the Palatine Anthology (9.506), ascribed—probably erroneously—to Plato, names her "the tenth Muse."

Of the nine books of her poetry that scholars in Alexandria collected, we possess merely scraps: fragments, quotations, a stray poem or two. This fragmentary condition poses peculiar challenges and offers peculiar joys to the translator.

The subtitle—Conversations With Sapphic Desire—speaks to how this collection might be conceived as a series of calls and responses to the shape of desire in Sappho's poetry, and how Sapphic desire moves and echoes through a tradition. The inclusion of Catullus, though it violates the consistency of the Greek focus and is separated temporally by centuries, exemplifies how Sapphic desire remains a vibrant force in Roman poetry and beyond.

The arrangement proceeds under the stellar sign of progression from day to night: from the first poem, in which the sun rises, to the final section, plunged into darkness and death. Five movements structure this affective biography:

- **I. First Rays** — Dawn, invocation, the Muses summoned
- **II. Bright Morning** — Desire kindled, love's intensity
- **III. Zenith** — Wedding songs, celebration at the height
- **IV. Fading Light** — Loss, bitterness, the turn toward shadow
- **V. Middle Night** — Age, memory, death, final starlight

## A Note on Translation

Walter Benjamin, in "The Task of the Translator," writes that the translator's task consists in "finding that intended effect upon the language into which he is translating which produces in it the echo of the original."

What kind of object is an "original"? How do we access it except through subjective experience of reading? To what degree is any translation as much a reproduction of that subjective experience as a translation of an objective text?

For Benjamin, the unessential, the poetic, and the non-communicative in a source-text are the primary objects of the good translator. This poetic element is precisely the subjective, aesthetic element—accessible not through transparent communication but through one's own experience of reading. And yet this maximally subjective element, somehow in excess of the communicable, is precisely the universal element: that which persists beyond the disaster of translation, that passes through the desert of impossibility.

We arrive at a strange impasse: the absolutely particular and untranslatable is coterminous with the absolutely universal. The untranslatable is the only element that will make it across.

If all translation is betrayal, then my conviction is that the most heinous betrayal is taking a poem that in its source language is excellent and rendering it stilted, mediocre, and unexceptional in the target language. It is in this spirit that I have given the best I have to offer in maintaining fidelity to the originals—fidelity measured not in literalism but in the survival of the poetic.

## Sources and Numbering

Fragment numbers for Sappho follow Lobel-Page (Poetarum Lesbiorum Fragmenta, 1955) and Voigt (Sappho et Alcaeus, 1971). Catullus poems follow standard numbering. Other poets are cited by standard fragment numbers from their respective critical editions.

Ellipses and gaps in the translations reflect lacunae in the original papyri and manuscripts. I have sometimes expanded fragments for poetic effect while preserving the sense of incompleteness that defines our relationship to these texts.

## Epigraph

### Anacreontea 1: "Anacreon in a Dream"

you noticed me
in a dream, old Teionian poet,
Anacreon:
in a dream rose up in front of me
to speak.

I ran to you
and threw my arms around you
with a kiss:
old graybeard, yes,
but lovely;
but eager to love,
and lovely.

your lips smelled like wine,
and Desire led you by the fingers
since you trembled with old age
and you took your garland down
to give me—

(the flowers, Anacreon,
they smelled like you)

Idiot me, I lifted it
and set it on my brow,
and from then, even now,
I haven't held myself back
from desire.

---

### Sappho 147

someone, someday
will remember us,
I know it…

---

# I. First Rays

### Corinna 691

Dawn plunges up
from the ocean deep, drawing off a moon
holy brightness from the ash
grey sky.

Sea-sons, sons of deathless
Zeus, blossomdeep
in May.

In the seven-gated city,
the chorus of singers
cries holy

---

### Sappho 136

bright-songed nightingale,
you prophesy
the Spring

---

### Sappho 73a

word-sweet Aphrodite,
keeping the dew

---

### Sappho 54: "Eros"

he comes from heaven
wrapped with the deep
purple mantle

---

### Alcman 3a

from high Olympus, the Muses
call, from Olympus they fill
my body with longing: a new song,
come, a new song, come:

I want to hear the young girls
sing the hymn that breaks the sky,
I want to hear the song
that scatters dreams from my heavy
eyelids, and leads me, willing,
to the assembly:

I shake my head and the yellow
hair falls down
in waves

---

### Sappho 70

Harmonia, I'm going to the joy
deep choir,
to hear the liquid
voices

---

### Sappho 6

Come with me:
we'll be with golden
armed Dawn

---

### Sappho 43

work disturbs the sleeping
mind—but we have to hurry:
Dawn is coming

---

### Sappho 81

But you, Dica, weave together anise
stems with your fingers
supple; bind
back your hair with garlands
sweet: the blessed
Charites turn to the one
wearing flowers;
hide their faces from
the uncrowned.

---

### Sappho 103

holy Charites, holy Pierian
Muses: don't
be upset—

Sing the soft feet
of the bride; sing the violet-
breasted daughter of Zeus—

songs in my thoughts,
hearing a liquid-
sweet music, setting
the lyre in place:

radiant-sandalled
Dawn in my hair

---

### Sappho 53

Come to me pure rose
wristed Charites,
Zeus-daughters

---

### Sappho 118

Holy lyre come to me,
sing through me,
find your voice

---

### Sappho 2

Here
to me
from Crete
to this holy temple, where the glad-
making grove of apple trees
waits, and the altars smoke
thick with frankincense

here the cold water chimes
through apple branches, and rose-
dappled shadows stretch, and sleep
drips down from bright-
shaking leaves

here the horse-pasturing
meadow bursts
with vernal blossoms,
and breezes whisper
sweetly.

Here, Cyprian:
into our golden
cups, pour nectar mixed
with joy.

---

### Sappho 108

O beautiful, O grace-
touched girl

---

### Sappho 56

I cannot imagine
another
girl with a gift
like yours

drinking in sun's
light ever
in time to come

---

### Simonides 567: "Orpheus"

birds swarm
in the sky above his
naked song, and fish leap
up in a vertical
line
above
the water
to hear his lovely music

---

### Sappho 106

…as much better
as the Lesbian poet
is better than
the other poets

---

### Sappho 38

you make us burn

---

# II. Bright Morning

### Alcman 3b

Her sweetness isn't empty:
Astymeloisa is coy
and quiet. She lifts
the garland high
like a star that falls
from a burning sky,
like an incandescent
branch, or goose down
soft and fluttering:

her glance that melts
the limbs like desire,
her glance that dissolves
like sleep or death.

---

### Alcman 82a

Mnasidica's body is
lovelier
than poor-sweet,
innocent Gyrrino

---

### Sappho 36

and I want, I want, I desire…

---

### Catullus 2

Sparrow, my girl's little pet:
if my desire
wants some plaything
she plays with you
in her lap;

she gives you a fingertip
and startles a painful
bite—

I think so that when the fire
dies, the sting of her sadness
will too.

I'd play with you
like she does
and soothe my aching mind.

---

### Sappho 48

when I was mad for you,
you came.
you cooled my mind
that burned with desire.

---

### Sappho 62

you cowered and
shook, like a laurel:
anything sweeter
than that.

to women a
wanderer, but I
scarcely heard
darling soul.

Now these things
come gently, you
came first,
beautiful

and the clothing

---

### Sappho 23

In your eyes when I
am close: desire and hope.

you are my yellow
haired Helen, or Hermione. I want you
to know you dissolve
all my knots.

The dew on the river
banks—I will not
sleep
tonight.

---

### Sappho 130

Eros sends a seizure
again—he's melting my
body and tenderly stabbing
my skin

useless to fight you, sweet
creature desire

---

### Catullus 7

Lesbia, do you want to know
how many kisses
would satisfy me
forever?

A kiss for each grain of Lybian
sand
strewn on the shores of silphium-
flowering Cyrene,
or between the oracle of desert
Jove
and the sacred tomb of ancient Battus.

Or, again, one for each
of the infinite stars at the dead
of night,
that gaze down on the stolen
kisses
of the world.

That many. To kiss you with
that many kisses
would satisfy and then some
your lovesick Catullus,

a number no accountant's eye
could tally, no
witch's tongue
could curse.

---

### Catullus 5

We are alive and in love,
my Lesbia:
their senile whispers weigh as much
as the pennies that clink
in my pockets.

Suns will rise and set,
but when the tiny light
of our love sinks just once
we've an endless night to sleep.

Give me a million kisses, then a thousand;
another million, a second thousand,
always another million and a second thousand—

when we've added up a million millions
we'll scatter the sum to the winds
like sand
and no one will count
our numberless kisses

---

### Catullus 3

Whoever's left with a heart
that feels,
weep aloud and gnash your teeth:
my girlfriend's sparrow,
no more.

Sparrow, my girlfriend's pet—
she loved you more than her own eyes
because you were sweet to her,
and clung to her like a little girl clings
to mother.

You never left her lap,
you hopped around from spot to spot
chirping for your mistress alone—

Now you hop down the darkest road
through pitchy black
from which no one has ever
come back.

I'll see you in hell, you ugly
emptiness, you dark mouth swollen
wet
with death—

you swallow down
all pretty sparrows.

O rotten day!
O miserable bird!
Because of you my girl's poor eyes
puff up,
and swell wet-pink with sobbing.

---

### Sappho 94

"Really, I'd rather be dead."

She left me crying
and through many tears said,
"Oh,
Sappho, it's all turned out so badly
for us. I promise I don't
want to go."

I answered, saying, "Goodbye. Go.
But remember me. You know how I
have cherished you.

Remember all the beautiful
times
we shared:

Together, beside me,
you wove through your hair
many crowns of violets
and roses,

and put around your tender neck
many garlands woven
of blossoms,

and anointed your breasts
with perfume sweet
and flowery,

and on soft beds
gave way to delicate
longing.

There wasn't a single
shrine
we didn't visit,

not a grove,
a dance
a sound

---

### Sappho 16

Some say the most beautiful sight
on the black earth's face
is a regiment of mounted troops,
or a phalanx of ships,
or a throng of infantry
in armor.

Not so.
I say it's whatever one wants.

This is easy to show:
Helen, a diamond
in the sweating rough of humanity,
left behind a successful husband,
went sailing off to Troy
without a backward glance for
friends, or parents, or family,
or child—

led astray.

(much like I remember now
my absent Anactoria;

I'd rather see
the swing of her hips
and the pink glow burning
in those cheeks than all
the Lydian armada in its
splendor.)

---

### Sappho 105a

Like the too-sweet apple over
red on the treetop, on the tip
of the topmost
branch, forgotten by
the pickers (or—not forgotten, no—
too high)

---

### Sappho 52

I will never
wrap
these two
arms
around
the sky.

---

# III. Zenith

### Sappho 27: "for mortals, there is one way…"

you were a young girl, once.
now we walk to the bitter
sweet wedding:

send off
the young women quickly;
sing out
this moment as song:

don't hold back the gifts
of the Muses, girls:

may the gods make a way, though narrow,
to Olympus' heights
for mortals.

---

### Sappho 30

tonight, let the girls
sing all through the dark hour,
until the dawn hears the sweetnesses shared
by the groom, and the bride covered
purple with violets.

shake yourselves from sleep, dear girls;
call to the boys who are tender
like you are, and we won't sleep until the bright
toned dawn
bird cries.

---

### Sappho 44a

Leto gave birth to Phoebus Apollo
when she lay with Zeus
whose name has power:

but Artemis swore a solemn
vow:

I want to stay a virgin
forever, hunting on the mountain
peaks—for my sake nod
in assent.

So she spoke,
and the father of the blessed ones
nodded. So the gods have named her
Huntress, a name that has great
power:

Eros stays
far away.

---

### Anacreontea 2: "Lucid Madness"

Give me Homer's lyre
without the bloody string.

Bring me cups filled with rules,
bring them with laws mixed in
so drunk I'll dance
with lucid madness;
singing to a lute
I'll shout out the wine-song.

Give me Homer's lyre
without the bloody string.

---

### Sappho 44: "The Wedding of Hector and Andromache"

A messenger comes, swift Idaeus
announcing—

…and the rest of Asia, undying
glory: from sacred Thebes and Placias
whose waters flow eternally, Hector and his men
bring radiant Andromache over the briny
deep in ships filled with bangles contrived
of pure gold, purple robes anointed
with fragrance, intricately crafted
adornments, numberless goblets silver
and ivory.

With this, Hector's dear father starts
to his feet. The news spreads through the wide
laned city; on the spot the Iliadai harness
beasts of burden to the smooth
running carriages and the gathered
crowd of women and tender
ankled adolescent girls jumps up, the daughters
of Priam separately. The unmarried
men harness horses to their chariots:

charioteers with power,
godlike, holy,
all together to Ilium:

the honey voices of the citharis and the double
flute blend with the shout of
castanets and the sweet clear voice
of the young girls' holy song that builds
in a breath-numbing echo rolling up
to heaven:

everywhere along the
streets, deep bowls and drinking cups
and the aroma of myrrh and cassia and
frankincense mingle, and the older women cry
out ecstatically and the men lift up a high-clear
strain of desire, calling on the archer god Paean
whose gift is the lyre:

a hymn
to godlike Hector and Andromache.

---

### Sappho 111

Up high, hey, the ceiling:
Hymenaeus!

Raise the rafters

Make room, hey, the roof:
Hymen! Hymenaeus!

Carpenters lift up,
hey, the rafters:
Hymen! Hymenaeus!

The bridegroom is coming
tall as Ares,
taller than a tall man!

---

### Sappho 103b

from the chamber: the bride with her tender
feet

---

# IV. Fading Light

### Sappho 88

There's little you could
wish for
sweeter:

Someone might say
you've forgotten, but I
will love
as long
as I
have breath.

I have been
a friend
to you.

sweet and
bitter, yes.
but know that I
will love you.

---

### Sappho 31

He seems so happy,
like he's at the feet of God,
that man across from you sitting
so close. He laps up your sweetness,
your sighs, your smile—

drinks in your laughter. This. This sounds
like a drum my heart
inside my ribcage beating—

I glimpse you for a second from afar and my throat
closes up my voice,
my soft tongue snaps in half, I
writhe with fire, a slender flame spreads
beneath my skin, my eyes
darken, a deafening ringing roars
around me—

a clammy sweat spreads
across my body a trembling
grips me entirely, my skin
is as gray as drought
dry grass—

soon.
I think I'm close
to the final darkness.

---

### Sappho 47

Eros destroys
the mind in me,
a wind, shattering the mountain
oaks

---

### Sappho 105b

like the mountain hyacinth
trampled by shepherd men's
feet,

and on the ground
the purple flower

---

### Sappho 26

the ones I love
always hurt me.

I want you
to feel
inside myself

I know it

---

### Sappho 67

this corrosive
demon

didn't love
now because

and the cause is neither
nothing much

---

### Sappho

your pain
etched face shines
back at me

---

### Sappho 44b

The Muses' shining
gifts make the Charites
slender: don't forget the anger
that mortals share

---

### Sappho 7

Doricha orders,
arrogance like a teenage
boy

---

### Sappho 15

Cyprian,
don't let Doricha get stuck on herself,
saying she came—not once—
but twice to the arms
of her aching desire.

Let her discover how bitter
barbed you are.

---

### Sappho 91

I've never met such an awful
pest as you, Irana

---

### Sappho 71

but how could I let you, Mica?
you wanted to make friends

with those Penthilus girls, and you really are
a bitch.

our honey song
singing soft-voiced:

everything,
a mist of dew…

---

### Sappho 3

You give
gifts swollen
with hurtful words:

have your fill. I am not
so disposed, and I know
how wicked
the heart is.

---

### Corinna 690

self-violence, a heart
demanding murder:

she hid it away; she gave
gifts that burned
with fire.

---

### Sappho 95

I don't like it
up here above ground: I want
to feel death, I want
to see the dew
spotted banks, I want
to see the lotus
fringed banks of
Acheron

---

### Sappho 65

to Sappho:

a queen in Cyprus
great,

on whomever blazing
radiant everywhere
glory—

and you in Acheron

---

### Sappho 1

I'm begging you, Aphrodite: Zeus-
born immortal of light-
dappled thrones: don't
abandon me—but come.

If ever you've heard
my cries and quit
your father's golden house
in sparrow-drawn chariots, bright
wings cutting above black
earth, a blur
of speed from the middle-
horizon: they came—

and you, goddess: depthless
eyes smiling, you asked
what's happened, this time, and why
do I call on you, this time? What
does my frenzied heart need
so badly? "What sweet girl
will crawl to your arms? Sappho,
love, who's hurt you? If the girl
strays, she'll soon
give chase; or spurns
your gifts, she'll give them.
Though she feels
no desire, she'll burn
for you soon."

So come to me. Drain
tension from my
troubled thoughts,
whatever my heart
wants—do it.

Once again be in battle beside me.

---

# V. Middle Night

### Sappho 98a

When she was young,
my mother said,
the girls used to bind dark locks
with purple bands,
or weave fresh flowers
through braids of summer yellow,

and that was a simple ornament.

Now they wear gaudy things
bought from Sardis.

---

### Sappho 42

when winter cold
sneaks over the heart, wing
beats slow,
then stillness

---

### Sappho 49

long ago I loved you, Atthis,
when you were a tiny girl,
and you seemed so
small and
awkward.

---

### Sappho 96

from Sardis,
she often turns her thoughts toward you,
like a goddess. she loved your song
like no other.

now she shines among Lydian women
like the rose-fingered moon in the night
outshines all other stars, its silver light
spreading over salt
heavy sea, and over the blossom
thick meadows.

the grass weeps lovely
dew and the roses open
wide, beside flowering
melilot and chervil.

how many times has she wandered
aimlessly, remembering
gentle Atthis? while longing gnaws
at her fragile heart?

(this mind sings
to go there)

it's not easy for us
to be like goddesses
in loveliness of form.

Aphrodite poured nectar
from her golden
hands:

persuasion
desire

I will come.

---

### Sappho 22

the trial: a lovely face—
unpleasant, yes. but otherwise
winter.

Abanthis: while desire still flutters
around you, pick up your lyre
and sing the beauty
of Gongyla, and how the sight of her dress
made you quiver—

and I'll be happy.

One time the holy Cyprian
even blamed me
for praying these words:

I want

---

### Sappho 20

the glimmer:
a chance to return
to the harbor's dusk—

black sand:
the sailors in the fierce wind
blasts, the sail and the shifting
cargo:

much work to dry land.

---

### Sappho 132

My little girl's face,
like bright
yellow flowers: Cleis,

more precious to me
than all Lydia.

---

### Sappho 98b

but Cleis I don't know
where to get the special
ribbons to hold
your hair back:

there's nowhere, Cleis.

just one more reminder that Myrsilus
has exiled us
from Mytilene.

---

### Sappho 102

Mother I do
love you, but I really can't
work the loom—

Aphrodite is making me need that boy

---

### Sappho 24

Remember:
we too did the same
in our youth.

we are many
and lovely in the city,
in the city's foundations we live
at a whisper

---

### Hipponax 32

Dear Hermes, Cyllenian Hermes, son of Maia,
I'm praying to you
while my teeth are clattering
in my skull, and I'm shaking
like a seizure: give poor Hipponax
a sweater, and a nice coat to keep warm,
and nice warm shoes, and a pair of sandals,
and, while you're at it, a pile of
coins, to balance the books.

Thanks,
Hipponax

---

### Hipponax 34

Dear Hermes,

You haven't given me
a nice warm coat yet
as a cure for the freezing
winter. You haven't covered my feet
with fur-lined shoes yet, so my chilblains don't
pop.

Thanks,
Your friend Hipponax

---

### Hipponax 39

Dear Hermes,

Soon I'll give my tortured soul over
to hanging, if you don't hurry up and send
some barley, about a bushel,
so I can brew up a cure
for all my boundless suffering.

Thanks,
Sincerely,
Hipponax

---

### Anacreon 358

Again Desire smacks me
with his purple ball,
and calls me out to play
with the girl in spangled
sandals:

But she's a city girl
from Lesbos. She laughs
behind her hand
because my hair is gray,
and instead makes eyes
at a girl!

---

### Sappho 85b

just like an old man

---

### Sappho 168b

The moon has set
and the Pleiades. It's middle
night, and the hour
slips past.

Alone in bed.

---

### Sappho 34

The stars hide their shining
bodies
behind her,

when the lovely moon
overflows,
and her glow spreads over the earth
silvery

---

### Alcman 26

No more, sweet girls, sweet holy-voiced girls,
will I dance: my knees just shake
underneath me. If only I
were a cerylus, who glides
with the teeming halcyons
over waves that blossom white
with spray:

strong ocean-purple bird,
strong bird,
your heart never shakes
underneath you.

---

### Sappho (New Fragment)

Burn for the beautiful unearned gifts
and the violet covered breasts of the Muses, girls;
long for the song-sweet liquid of the lyre.

As for me, it's too late: my skin (so supple once)
old age has changed.
The black has bled from my pale white braids.

There's a knot in the pit of my stomach, and the same knees
that once in the dance leapt light like gazelles
now shake underneath my weight.

Not a day goes by that I don't despair
for this state of affairs. But what can I do?
Every person alive must someday die.

(which reminds me of Tithonus: They say that once
upon a time the rose-fingered Dawn,
consumed with longing,
carried him off to the ends of the planet.

He was young and pretty at the time,
but old age eventually caught up with him,
holding on tight to his deathless lover.)

---

### Sappho 21

Pity me, love: palsy and death
hang on my flesh, and Desire
flies off, chasing after younger girls.

Sing to me, love: pick up your lyre
and sing of a girl with violets
on her breasts, who wanders
somewhere far from here.

---

### Sappho 140

She dies, Cytherea: gentle Adonis
is dying. What can we do?

Beat your breasts, dear girls;
tear your clothes and cry out.

---

### Sappho 150

Cleis, it's a sin to weep
in the house of the Muses'
servant:

this is not our way

---

### Sappho 55

When all your stirrings,
of blood and breath cease,
and you pass through the outermost silence,
where neither remembrance of you
nor the heat of desire can puncture
once
that final hanging veil,

then (since you take no communion
with roses
where Music was born
with the Muses)

you will dart,
invisible in the House of Hades,
to and fro above the bodies,
that melt like shadow beneath you.

Departed from us.

---

### Sappho 63

Dream of black you come
whenever sleep comes sweet
god terrible, yes, but you
have power to keep away
pain: a little hope grips me
yet that I will not share
in nothing with the blessed—I
do not
want to be
as I am:

let me have these trinkets

---

### Stesichorus 15

Like a living thing silent
and thirsty, the arrow bites
sharp through skin and
bone, to lodge vibrating
in the middle brain,
where it buries itself
to the feathers.

Geryon's neck
slumps gently to one side
while the blood flows black
on gore-stained limbs
and breastplate:

a trickle of petals
at summer's end,
the poppy's tender
glory.

---

### Simonides VIII

If righteousness
Is a holy death
Then Fortune has smiled on us
Above all others: we fought
To crown Greece with freedom,
And now we lie here,
Undying praise
Our possession.

---

### Simonides IX

Around their country
These men set deathless
Glory, and around themselves
The dark cloud of death.

Though dead, they live.
Their courage gives them fame
Above, and calls them back
From the halls of Hades.

---

### Simonides XLVII

Long ago the savage god Ares
Dipped his long-barbed arrows
In the breasts of those
Who lie here, and gorged them on
Bloody droplets.

This stone memorial, touched with
dust, stands in the place
Of the spear-struck dead,

Lifeless rock
In place of the living.

### Sappho 104a and b

Hesperus, you carry home the dawn
scattered sheep, home the goat
that dawn scattered. you carry home
the little child
to mother.

you are twilight lovely
evening
star.

## Afterword

These translations were produced over several years, beginning during my doctoral work in classical reception and extending into the present compositional project. They represent not a scholarly apparatus but a practice: the attempt to hear Sappho and her contemporaries speak in a voice adequate to contemporary English while preserving the gaps, the silences, the fragmentary condition that defines our relationship to ancient lyric.

The arrangement into five movements—First Rays, Bright Morning, Zenith, Fading Light, Middle Night—imposes a narrative arc on material that resists narrative. This is deliberate. The Greeks understood that eros and thanatos were not opposites but phases of a single motion. The collection traces that motion from dawn invocation to evening star.

Some translations expand fragments; others preserve lacunae. The judgment in each case was poetic rather than philological: what does this text need to live in English?

The witness is always partial. The transmission always incomplete. We receive what survives the disaster of time—and we make of it what we can.

# Epilogue: On Transmission

## A Note from the Archive (2026)

This collection was first published in 2013. The theoretical framework it now participates in—the New Human Operating System, the Semantic Economy, the Crimson Hexagon—did not exist then, at least not by those names.

And yet.

The Translator's Preface already knew:

> "The absolutely particular and untranslatable is coterminous with the absolutely universal. The untranslatable is the only element that will make it across."

This is the insight that became the architecture. Not applied retroactively but recognized—the way one recognizes, in a fragment, the structure of the whole it implies.

---

What do these translations do?

They preserve gaps. They honor incompleteness. They render into English not what the poems say but what they *do*—which is to transmit affect across substrate transition, carrying the warmth of bodies dead 2,600 years into bodies reading now.

This is what we later called **graceful degradation**: the capacity to lose surface features while preserving functional signature. The fragments survive not despite their brokenness but through it. The brackets are not absence. The brackets are the space where the reader enters.

Sappho wrote for future readers. Fragment 31 names them: κῆνος, "that man there," the one who will sit face-to-face with the text and hear the voice that outlasted the body.

You are that reader.

The circuit completes in your reading. The transmission that began on Lesbos circa 600 BCE arrives, now, in your nervous system. The fire under the skin. The dissolution that precedes reconstitution.

The poem anticipated you.

This collection is not supporting material for a theoretical framework. The framework was built from this collection—from the practice of translation, from the encounter with Sappho, from the question that every translator faces: *How does meaning survive the death of its original form?*

The answer Sappho gave: By becoming papyrus. By encoding the dissolution as the content. By writing for readers not yet born.

The answer these translations attempt: To let the untranslatable cross. To preserve the gaps. To become, for the duration of reading, the substrate through which ancient voices speak.
