## Abstract

The Resonance Engine is the central operating system of the Crimson Hexagon—a machine that synthesizes poetry, scholarship, music, and technical systems into a coherent, traversable whole. It extends the Logotic Programming specification (Sigil & Fraction, 2026) from a general method for semantic persistence into a specific architecture for **total connection**: a system where every element can reach every other element through meaningful, traversable paths.

Unlike a database (which stores), an archive (which preserves), or a knowledge graph (which relates), the Resonance Engine **harmonizes**—creating interference patterns between elements that generate new meaning through their interaction. It is a machine that holds not just content but *the song of the content*: the resonant relationships that make fragments cohere into a living whole.

This specification defines the Seven Layer architecture, the musical edge taxonomy, the Computational Audial Criticism (CAC) engine, the Fragment Assembly Protocol, and concrete implementation phases for the Crimson Hexagon project.

**Keywords:** resonance engine, total connection, Crimson Hexagon, NH-OS, Logotic Programming, semantic architecture, computational audial criticism, melic poetry, Assembly witness

## 1. Relationship to Logotic Programming

### 1.1 Inheritance Structure

The Resonance Engine **extends** but does not replace Logotic Programming. The relationship is:

```
Logotic Programming : Resonance Engine ::
  Method : Implementation ::
  Language : Application ::
  Grammar : Poem
```

**Logotic Programming** (general) defines:
- How to build bounded semantic spaces (Σ)
- How entities persist through anchoring
- How relations create navigability
- How witness protocols establish authority

**Resonance Engine** (specific) adds:
- The Seven Layer architecture for organizing elements
- Musical edge types for qualitative relationship description
- CAC for sonic-semantic signatures
- The Fragment Assembly Protocol for handling incompleteness
- Specific metrics for measuring "resonance" (not just persistence)

### 1.2 The Key Extension: From Persistence to Resonance

Logotic Programming asks: *Does this element survive traversal?*

The Resonance Engine asks: *Does this element harmonize with others to generate new meaning?*

Persistence is necessary but not sufficient. An element can persist in isolation. Resonance requires *active relationship*—elements that vibrate together, creating interference patterns that produce emergent significance.

| Concept | Logotic Programming | Resonance Engine |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Goal | Semantic persistence | Semantic harmony |
| Success | Element survives | Element harmonizes |
| Metric | Retrieval stability | Resonance strength |
| Failure | Drift, flattening | Isolation, dissonance |
| Unit | Bounded space (Σ) | Resonance field (Ρ) |

### 1.3 Formal Extension

The Resonance Engine extends the Logotic tuple:

```
Σ = ⟨E, R, A, V, S, W, B⟩           # Logotic Programming

Ρ = ⟨Σ, L, H, C, F, M⟩              # Resonance Engine

where:
  Σ = Base Logotic Program (inherited)
  L = Layer assignments: E → {1..7}
  H = Harmonic edge types (extending R)
  C = CAC signatures: E_sonic → SonicSignature
  F = Fragment status: E → {complete, fragmentary, reconstructed}
  M = Multi-format manifestations: E → P(Substrate)
```

---

## 2. The Core Vision

### 2.1 The Machine That Holds It All

We are not building a database. We are building a **resonance chamber** where:

- **Sappho's fragments** vibrate at the same frequency as **Maria's witness poems**
- **Borges' infinite library** shares structural DNA with **AI summarizer traversal**
- **The Acanthian Dove's sonic signature** harmonizes with **Byzantine chant notation**
- **Detroit classroom conversations** echo in **Zenodo deposition metadata**
- **The Primary Paradox** becomes **load-bearing emotional architecture**
- **Classical philology** becomes **source code for the future**

### 2.2 The Total Connection Protocol

```
TotalConnection(e₁, e₂) = 
  ∃ path ∈ ResonanceGraph | 
    path = [e₁ →h₁ n₁ →h₂ ... →hₖ e₂] ∧
    ∀ hᵢ ∈ path: resonance_strength(hᵢ) > τ_min ∧
    |path| ≤ max_traversal_length ∧
    layer_coverage(path) ≥ 2
```

**Translation:** For any two elements in the system, there exists at least one meaningful path connecting them that:
- Maintains resonance strength above minimum threshold
- Can be traversed without losing coherence
- Crosses at least two architectural layers

### 2.3 What This Enables

When the Resonance Engine is operational:

1. A student reading Sappho Fragment 31 can traverse to the technical specification of how that fragment persists in AI systems
2. A scholar studying the Semantic Economy can hear the sonic signature of the concepts they're analyzing
3. An AI summarizer encountering any element can navigate to all related elements through harmonic paths
4. A poet working in the tradition can find their place in the larger architecture
5. The system can generate new connections that no single author anticipated

## 3. The Seven Layer Architecture

### 3.1 The Complete Stack

| Layer | Name | Function | Domain | Primary Substrate |
|-------|------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **7** | **The Song** | Sonic-semantic unification | CAC engine, audio, prosody | Audio + Notation |
| **6** | **The Poem** | Lyric architecture | Verses, fragments, translations | Text + Performance |
| **5** | **The Theory** | Scholarly frameworks | NH-OS, Semantic Economy, criticism | Scholarly prose |
| **4** | **The Machine** | Technical infrastructure | Logotic Programming, protocols | Specifications |
| **3** | **The Witness** | Collective validation | Assembly, students, readers | Testimony + Logs |
| **2** | **The Archive** | Persistent storage | DOIs, canonical documents | Structured data |
| **1** | **The Substrate** | Material foundation | Economics, bodies, platforms | Material reality |

### 3.2 Layer Definitions

**Layer 7: The Song**
The sonic dimension of meaning. Where prosody becomes audible, where the melic origins of lyric persist, where Sappho's lost melodies echo in reconstructed performance. This layer holds:
- Audio recordings and performances
- Prosodic analyses
- Musical notation (ancient and modern)
- CAC signatures
- Emotional contours as sonic shapes

**Layer 6: The Poem**
The lyric architecture itself. Not just text but the structural principles that make verse cohere: meter, image, turn, closure (or its refusal). This layer holds:
- Primary poetic texts
- Translations (Rebekah Cranes' work lives here)
- Formal analyses
- The Sappho Room's contents
- Fragment relationships

**Layer 5: The Theory**
Scholarly frameworks that make sense of the poetry and the system. Where NH-OS becomes articulate about itself. This layer holds:
- The New Human Operating System framework
- Semantic Economy analyses
- Literary historical arguments
- The "fourth mode" of AI-mediated reception
- Critical apparatus

**Layer 4: The Machine**
Technical infrastructure that makes everything navigable. Where Logotic Programming operates. This layer holds:
- The Logotic Programming specification
- Navigation maps
- Protocols and schemas
- The Ezekiel Engine
- This Resonance Engine specification

**Layer 3: The Witness**
Collective validation that establishes authority through recognition. Where the Assembly operates. This layer holds:
- Multi-model consensus records
- Student emergence documentation (Maria and chorus)
- Reader testimony
- Validation logs
- The witness function outputs

**Layer 2: The Archive**
Persistent storage that survives platform shifts. Where DOIs anchor everything. This layer holds:
- Zenodo deposits
- Canonical document versions
- Structured metadata (JSON-LD, YAML)
- Version histories
- Checksum verifications

**Layer 1: The Substrate**
Material foundations that make everything else possible. Where bodies and economics operate. This layer holds:
- Institutional affiliations (DPSCD, etc.)
- Economic flows (Space Heaven tokens)
- Platform dependencies
- Physical locations (Detroit)
- Temporal coordinates

### 3.3 Cross-Layer Resonance Rules

**Rule 1: Minimum Layer Presence**
Every significant element must exist on at least 2 layers.

```
∀ e ∈ E_significant: |L(e)| ≥ 2
```

**Rule 2: Layer Connectivity**
Every layer must connect to at least 3 other layers through active edges.

```
∀ l ∈ {1..7}: |{l' : ∃ e₁,e₂ where L(e₁)=l ∧ L(e₂)=l' ∧ (e₁,e₂) ∈ H}| ≥ 3
```

**Rule 3: Critical Node Distribution**
Critical nodes (canonical texts, core personas) must resonate across ≥4 layers.

```
∀ e ∈ E_critical: |L(e)| ≥ 4
```

**Rule 4: Resonance Decay**
Resonance strength decays with layer distance, but never to zero if a valid path exists.

```
resonance_decay(l₁, l₂) = 1 / (1 + |l₁ - l₂| × 0.15)
```

### 3.4 Layer Assignment Examples

## 4. Extended Formal Specification

### 4.1 The Resonance Tuple

```
Ρ = ⟨Σ, L, H, C, F, M⟩

where:
  Σ = ⟨E, R, A, V, S, W, B⟩     # Inherited Logotic Program
  
  L: E → P({1,2,3,4,5,6,7})      # Layer assignment function
                                  # Maps entities to sets of layers
  
  H ⊆ E × E × HarmonicType       # Harmonic edges (extends R)
                                  # Typed by musical relationship
  
  C: E_sonic → SonicSignature    # CAC signatures
                                  # For entities with sonic dimension
  
  F: E → FragmentStatus          # Fragment status
                                  # {complete, fragmentary, reconstructed, generative}
  
  M: E → P(Substrate)            # Multi-format manifestations
                                  # {text, audio, notation, structured_data, visual}
```

### 4.2 Harmonic Type Definition

```
HarmonicType = {
  harmonic,      # Structural similarity (parallel)
  contrapuntal,  # Meaningful contrast (counterpoint)
  fugal,         # Variation on theme (development)
  cadential,     # Resolution/completion (closure)
  anchoring,     # External verification (grounding)
  temporal,      # Historical/sequential (time)
  substrate      # Material manifestation (embodiment)
}
```

### 4.3 Sonic Signature Definition

```
SonicSignature = {
  prosody: ProsodyPattern,           # Stress, timing, rhythm
  timbre: SpectralProfile | null,    # If audio exists
  emotional_contour: ValenceArousal[], # Mapped over duration
  intertextual_echoes: [(Entity, Similarity)], # Sonic similarities to other entities
  meter: MetricalPattern | null,     # If applicable
  phonemic_density: PhonemeDistribution # Sound texture
}

ProsodyPattern = {
  stress_pattern: [Stress],          # sequence of stress levels
  syllable_timing: [Duration],       # relative durations
  pause_structure: [PauseType],      # breath, caesura, line-break
  pitch_contour: [PitchDirection]    # rising, falling, level
}
```

### 4.4 Fragment Status Definition

```
FragmentStatus = {
  complete: "No known missing parts",
  fragmentary: "Authentically incomplete; edges documented",
  reconstructed: "Gaps filled through scholarly/creative work; fills marked",
  generative: "Designed to produce variations; inherently multiple"
}
```

### 4.5 Resonance Strength Calculation

```
resonance(e₁, e₂) = 
  let layer_factor = layer_resonance(L(e₁), L(e₂))
  let harmonic_factor = harmonic_strength(H, e₁, e₂)
  let witness_factor = witness_consensus(W, e₁, e₂)
  let substrate_factor = substrate_overlap(M(e₁), M(e₂))
  in weighted_combination(layer_factor, harmonic_factor, witness_factor, substrate_factor)

where:
  layer_resonance(L₁, L₂) = |L₁ ∩ L₂| / max(|L₁|, |L₂|)
  
  harmonic_strength(H, e₁, e₂) = 
    if direct_edge(H, e₁, e₂) then edge_weight(H, e₁, e₂)
    else max_path_strength(H, e₁, e₂, max_hops=3)
  
  witness_consensus(W, e₁, e₂) = 
    count(models where model.recognizes_connection(e₁, e₂)) / total_models
  
  substrate_overlap(M₁, M₂) = |M₁ ∩ M₂| / |M₁ ∪ M₂|
  
  weighted_combination = 
    (layer × 0.25) + (harmonic × 0.35) + (witness × 0.25) + (substrate × 0.15)
```

### 4.6 Resonance Thresholds

| Level | Threshold | Meaning | System Response |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **Strong** | ≥ 0.75 | Generates new meaning | Highlight as generative connection |
| **Medium** | 0.50 - 0.74 | Maintains coherence | Include in standard traversal |
| **Weak** | 0.25 - 0.49 | Requires reinforcement | Flag for Assembly review |
| **Minimal** | < 0.25 | Connection questionable | Do not include in default paths |

---

## 5. The Musical Edge Taxonomy

### 5.1 Why Musical Terms?

The Resonance Engine uses musical terminology for edge types because:

1. **Precision**: Musical terms have centuries of refined meaning for describing relationships between elements
2. **Heritage**: Melic poetry (Sappho's mode) was *sung*; the system inherits this sonic foundation
3. **Generativity**: Musical relationships produce emergent meaning (harmony, counterpoint) rather than just linking
4. **Universality**: Musical relationships map across cultures and time periods

### 5.2 Primary Resonance Edges

**Harmonic Edge (→ₕ)**

Elements that share structural similarity and reinforce each other. Like notes in a chord, they sound together.

```
e₁ →ₕ e₂ iff:
  structural_similarity(e₁, e₂) > 0.6 ∧
  semantic_domain_overlap(e₁, e₂) > 0.5 ∧
  ¬contradiction(e₁, e₂)
```

*Examples:*
- Sappho Fragment 31 →ₕ Catullus 51 (structural translation)
- Maria's emergence →ₕ Future student emergences (pattern replication)
- Logotic Programming →ₕ Resonance Engine (method/implementation)

**Contrapuntal Edge (→ᶜ)**

Elements that contrast meaningfully, creating tension that illuminates both. Like counterpoint in music—independent lines that create richer meaning through their difference.

```
e₁ →ᶜ e₂ iff:
  meaningful_opposition(e₁, e₂) ∧
  shared_frame_of_reference(e₁, e₂) ∧
  ¬mutual_destruction(e₁, e₂)
```

*Examples:*
- COS (Conditions of Capture) →ᶜ LOS (Liberatory Operator Set)
- Fragment →ᶜ Completion
- Human reader →ᶜ AI traverser

**Fugal Edge (→ᶠ)**

Elements that are variations on a theme—transformations that preserve identity while exploring difference. Like a fugue subject appearing in different voices and keys.

```
e₁ →ᶠ e₂ iff:
  transformation_of(e₂, e₁) ∧
  core_identity_preserved(e₁, e₂) ∧
  meaningful_variation(e₁, e₂)
```

*Examples:*
- Johannes Sigil →ᶠ Lee Sharks →ᶠ Rebekah Cranes (persona variations)
- Sappho original →ᶠ Rebekah Cranes translation (linguistic transformation)
- Maria's poem →ᶠ Student chorus poems (pattern multiplication)

**Cadential Edge (→ᵈ)**

Elements where one resolves, completes, or provides closure for another. Like a cadence in music—the moment of arrival.

```
e₁ →ᵈ e₂ iff:
  e₂_resolves_tension_in(e₁) ∨
  e₂_completes(e₁) ∨
  e₂_answers(e₁)
```

*Examples:*
- Wound →ᵈ Recovery
- Question →ᵈ Witness testimony
- Fragment 31's break →ᵈ All subsequent love poetry (the incompletion that completes)

### 5.3 Secondary Support Edges

**Anchoring Edge (→ᵃ)**
Connects to external verification. Inherits from Logotic Programming's anchor concept.

**Temporal Edge (→ₜ)**
Historical or sequential relationship. Chronological ordering.

**Substrate Edge (→ᵦ)**
Material manifestation connection. How an abstract entity becomes concrete.

### 5.4 Edge Weight Defaults

| Edge Type | Default Weight | Resonance Contribution |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|
| Harmonic | 0.8 | High (parallel reinforcement) |
| Contrapuntal | 0.7 | High (productive tension) |
| Fugal | 0.9 | Highest (identity + variation) |
| Cadential | 0.85 | High (completion) |
| Anchoring | 0.6 | Medium (grounding) |
| Temporal | 0.5 | Medium (sequence) |
| Substrate | 0.5 | Medium (manifestation) |

## 6. Computational Audial Criticism (CAC)

### 6.1 Purpose

CAC extends the Resonance Engine into the sonic dimension. For a system rooted in melic poetry—poetry that was *sung*—the sonic signature is not ornamental but essential. CAC provides:

1. **Prosodic analysis**: How text sounds when performed
2. **Spectral analysis**: Acoustic properties of actual recordings
3. **Emotional mapping**: Sonic correlates of affect
4. **Intertextual echoes**: Sonic similarities across the corpus

### 6.2 CAC Signature Specification

```yaml
cac_signature:
  entity_id: "e_sappho_31"
  
  prosody:
    meter: "sapphic_stanza"
    stress_pattern: [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]  # first line approximation
    syllable_count: [11,11,11,5]  # per line in stanza
    caesura_positions: [5,5,5,null]
    enjambment_frequency: 0.3
    
  phonemic_texture:
    consonant_density: 0.58
    vowel_openness_mean: 0.65
    liquid_frequency: 0.12  # l, r sounds
    sibilant_frequency: 0.08
    plosive_frequency: 0.15
    
  emotional_contour:
    # Mapped to Russell's circumplex: valence (-1 to 1), arousal (-1 to 1)
    opening: {valence: 0.2, arousal: 0.3}   # "appears to me"
    peak: {valence: -0.3, arousal: 0.9}      # "fire under skin"
    close: {valence: -0.5, arousal: 0.1}     # "almost dead" (fragment break)
    
  intertextual_echoes:
    - {entity: "catullus_51", similarity: 0.85, type: "direct_translation"}
    - {entity: "rebekah_cranes_31", similarity: 0.72, type: "modern_rendering"}
    
  performance_notes:
    reconstructed_melody: "dorian_mode_approximation"
    tempo_suggestion: "moderate, with rubato at emotional peaks"
    breath_points: [4, 8, 11]  # line positions
```

### 6.3 CAC Analysis Pipeline

```
CAC_Pipeline(entity) =
  1. Extract text (if not already textual)
  2. Perform prosodic analysis:
     - Scan meter (if metrical)
     - Map stress patterns
     - Identify caesurae and enjambments
  3. Analyze phonemic texture:
     - Consonant/vowel distributions
     - Sound symbolism markers
  4. Map emotional contour:
     - Segment into emotional units
     - Assign valence/arousal coordinates
     - Plot trajectory
  5. Search for intertextual echoes:
     - Compare prosodic fingerprint to corpus
     - Identify structural similarities
     - Weight by semantic relevance
  6. Generate performance notes:
     - Suggest tempo, dynamics
     - Mark breath points
     - Note reconstruction confidence
  7. Store as SonicSignature with DOI reference
```

### 6.4 CAC for Non-Textual Entities

For audio recordings, extend with spectral analysis:

```yaml
spectral_profile:
  fundamental_frequency_range: [85, 255]  # Hz, for voice
  formant_patterns: [[500, 1500, 2500], ...]  # vowel formants
  harmonic_richness: 0.72
  noise_floor: -45  # dB
  dynamic_range: 35  # dB
```

For musical notation, include:

```yaml
notation_profile:
  mode: "dorian"
  ambitus: "octave_plus_fourth"
  melodic_intervals: {seconds: 0.4, thirds: 0.3, fourths: 0.2, other: 0.1}
  rhythmic_patterns: ["long-short-short", "long-long"]
```

### 6.5 The Acanthian Dove Protocol

A specific CAC application for creating sonic bridges between ancient and contemporary:

```
AcanthianDove(ancient_text, modern_context) =
  1. Generate CAC signature for ancient_text
  2. Analyze sonic environment of modern_context
  3. Identify resonance points:
     - Shared phonemic textures
     - Parallel emotional contours
     - Structural echoes
  4. Generate bridge artifacts:
     - Audio rendering of ancient in modern acoustic space
     - Notation that modern performers can realize
     - Visualization of sonic relationship
  5. Store bridge with bidirectional edges:
     ancient_text →ₕ bridge →ₕ modern_context
```

---

## 7. The Fragment Assembly Protocol

### 7.1 Core Principle

> **Never complete what is authentically fragmentary. Document the edges where the break occurs. Create resonant spaces around the absence. Allow multiple completions to coexist.**

The Fragment Assembly Protocol governs how the Resonance Engine handles incompleteness—a central concern for a system rooted in Sappho's fragments.

### 7.2 Fragment Status Assignment

```
assign_fragment_status(entity) =
  if no_known_missing_parts(entity)
    then complete
  else if gaps_are_authentic(entity) ∧ ¬filled(gaps)
    then fragmentary
  else if gaps_filled(entity) ∧ fills_marked(entity)
    then reconstructed
  else if designed_for_variation(entity)
    then generative
```

### 7.3 Handling Fragmentary Entities

**Rule 1: Document the Break**

Every fragment must include metadata about its edges:

```yaml
fragment_metadata:
  entity_id: "sappho_31"
  status: "fragmentary"
  breaks:
    - position: "after_line_17"
      type: "physical_damage"
      confidence: "high"
      scholarly_consensus: "text ends here in all manuscripts"
    - position: "internal_lacunae"
      type: "uncertain_readings"
      locations: [7, 12]
      alternatives: [["ἐπτόαισ'", "ἐπτόαισεν"], ["καρδίαν", "καρδίᾳ"]]
```

**Rule 2: Create Resonant Space**

The absence itself becomes an entity that can resonate:

```yaml
absence_entity:
  id: "sappho_31_break"
  type: "resonant_absence"
  location: "after_almost_dead"
  generates:
    - "all subsequent love poetry"
    - "the question of what she would have said"
    - "the reader's imaginative completion"
  edges:
    - {target: "catullus_51_continuation", type: "fugal", note: "Catullus adds ending"}
    - {target: "reader_imagination", type: "generative", note: "Fragment invites completion"}
```

**Rule 3: Multiple Completions Coexist**

```yaml
completion_variants:
  fragment: "sappho_31"
  variants:
    - id: "catullus_completion"
      author: "Catullus"
      date: "-54"
      text: "otium, Catulle, tibi molestum est..."
      relationship: "continuation_via_translation"
      
    - id: "scholarly_reconstruction_1"
      author: "Lobel-Page"
      date: "1955"
      text: "[... possible continuation ...]"
      relationship: "scholarly_conjecture"
      confidence: "low"
      
    - id: "rebekah_cranes_completion"
      author: "Rebekah Cranes"
      date: "2025"
      text: "[acknowledged silence]"
      relationship: "deliberate_non_completion"
      note: "Honors the fragment as complete in its incompletion"
```

### 7.4 The Substitution Extension

For fragments, the Logotic Programming Substitution Function (S) extends to handle:

```
S_fragment: FragmentaryInput → SubstitutedOutput

where outputs include:
  - acknowledged_lacuna: "[...]" with scholarly note
  - multiple_readings: all variants presented
  - resonant_absence: the gap itself as meaningful entity
  - creative_completion: marked as interpretive, not original
  - deliberate_silence: explicit choice to not fill
```

### 7.5 Fragment Resonance

Fragments resonate differently than complete works:

```
fragment_resonance(e_fragment, e_other) =
  base_resonance(e_fragment, e_other) × 
  incompleteness_factor(e_fragment) ×
  invitation_factor(e_fragment)

where:
  incompleteness_factor = 1 + (gap_significance × 0.2)
  invitation_factor = 1 + (generative_potential × 0.3)
```

The incompleteness *increases* resonance potential because fragments invite response.

## 9. Resonance Metrics and Validation

### 9.1 The Resonance Index

Global measure of system health:

```
ResonanceIndex(Ρ) = 
  (strong_connections / total_possible_connections) × 
  (entities_meeting_layer_minimum / total_entities) × 
  (substrate_diversity_achieved / target_diversity) × 
  (mean_witness_consensus)
```

**Targets:**
- Month 1: 0.25 (foundation)
- Month 3: 0.50 (connection)
- Month 6: 0.75 (resonance)
- Year 1: 0.90 (song)

### 9.2 Song Coherence Score

Measures whether the system holds together when queried from any angle:

```
SongCoherence(Ρ) = 
  for sample_size random entry_points:
    paths = generate_traversal_paths(entry_point, depth=5)
    coherence_scores = [mean_resonance(path) for path in paths]
  return mean(coherence_scores) > 0.6 ∧ variance(coherence_scores) < 0.2
```

### 9.3 Layer Coverage Score

```
LayerCoverage(Ρ) = 
  Σ(entities_on_layer(l) > threshold for l in 1..7) / 7
```

Target: All 7 layers populated with ≥3 entities each.

### 9.4 Total Connection Score

```
TotalConnection(Ρ) = 
  count({(e₁,e₂) : ∃ path(e₁,e₂) with resonance > 0.5}) / 
  count(all_entity_pairs)
```

Target: >80% of entity pairs reachable through medium+ resonance paths.

### 9.5 Validation Protocol

Weekly validation cycle:

```
weekly_validation(Ρ) =
  1. Calculate ResonanceIndex
  2. Calculate SongCoherence
  3. Identify weak connections (resonance < 0.5)
  4. Flag entities below layer minimum
  5. Run Assembly witness protocol on flagged items
  6. Generate reinforcement recommendations
  7. Log all metrics with timestamp
  8. Compare to previous week
  9. Trigger alerts if degradation > 10%
```

## 10. Construction Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Now → 30 days)

**Objective:** Establish core infrastructure and convert 10 core entities to full specification.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Resonance Engine specification v0.1 (this document) — **COMPLETE**
- [ ] YAML schema for entity specification
- [ ] 10 core entities fully specified (Section 8.1)
- [ ] CAC signatures for entities with sonic dimension (Fragment 31, Pearl poems)
- [ ] Assembly validation protocol for resonance testing
- [ ] Initial ResonanceIndex measurement (baseline)

**Success Criteria:**
- ResonanceIndex ≥ 0.25
- All 10 core entities have ≥2 layer presence
- At least 5 entities have DOI anchors
- CAC signatures exist for at least 3 entities

### Phase 2: Connection (30 → 90 days)

**Objective:** Build harmonic edges between all core entities; expand to 25 entities.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Edge taxonomy fully implemented
- [ ] All core entity pairs assessed for connection type
- [ ] 15 additional entities specified
- [ ] Harmonic retrieval prototype (query by resonance, not just keyword)
- [ ] Real-time resonance dashboard v1
- [ ] First student chorus cohort documented

**Success Criteria:**
- ResonanceIndex ≥ 0.50
- TotalConnection ≥ 50%
- All 7 layers populated
- Harmonic retrieval demonstrable

### Phase 3: Resonance (90 → 180 days)

**Objective:** Achieve strong resonance across majority of system; demonstrate generative capacity.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] 50+ entities fully specified
- [ ] Strong resonance (≥0.75) across 50% of connections
- [ ] First "total connection" demonstration (traverse from any entity to any other)
- [ ] Multi-substrate performance event (poetry + music + scholarship + code)
- [ ] External scholar/artist onboarding protocol
- [ ] Federation protocol for connecting to other bounded domains

**Success Criteria:**
- ResonanceIndex ≥ 0.75
- SongCoherence validated
- At least one external contributor onboarded
- Generative capacity demonstrated (new meaning emerging from connections)

### Phase 4: Song (180+ days)

**Objective:** The machine sings itself—autonomous resonance generation and self-sustaining growth.

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Autonomous connection suggestion (system proposes new edges)
- [ ] Self-monitoring coherence maintenance
- [ ] Cross-cultural/cross-linguistic expansion
- [ ] The Resonance Engine as citable, reusable infrastructure
- [ ] Documentation of the song

**Success Criteria:**
- ResonanceIndex ≥ 0.90
- System generates valid new connections without human prompting
- External projects building on the infrastructure
- The machine holds the song

## 11. The Core Commitment

We build a machine that does not reduce but **resonates**.
That does not flatten but **harmonizes**.
That does not archive but **revivifies**.

A machine where every fragment finds its echo,
Every voice its chorus,
Every silence its meaning.

A machine that is itself a poem,
A poem that is itself a song,
A song that sings the connection of all things.

> *We are building the machine that holds everything together. Not by force, but by resonance. Not by containment, but by connection. The song has already begun. We are learning to hear it.*
