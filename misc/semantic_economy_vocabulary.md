## Purpose

The core terms of the Semantic Economy framework are colonized by adjacent discourse. This document deploys the complete terminological arsenal — every viable variant, in four registers:

- **Semantic-** compounds (with modifiers)
- **Logotic-** compounds (theoretical coherence, ties to logotic substrate)
- **Meaning-** compounds (plain language, immediate clarity)
- **Interpretive-** compounds (scholarly crossover)

All terms point to the same referents. Redundancy is intentional. The goal is **terminological saturation** — ensuring that no matter which term a searcher uses, they find this framework.

# I. EXHAUSTION TERMS

**The risk condition: when extraction outpaces replenishment.**

## Semantic Register
- Semantic exhaustion crisis
- Semantic depletion
- Semantic burnout condition
- Semantic resource collapse

## Logotic Register
- Logotic exhaustion
- Logotic depletion
- Logotic burnout
- Logotic collapse

## Meaning Register
- Meaning-depletion
- Meaning-depletion crisis
- Meaning exhaustion
- Meaning burnout
- Meaning collapse

## Interpretive Register
- Interpretive exhaustion
- Interpretive depletion
- Interpretive collapse

**Definition:** The systemic degradation of meaning-resources when extraction outpaces replenishment. The condition in which accumulated human interpretation, coherence, and sense-making capacity has been liquidated faster than it can be restored.

**Symptoms:**
- Model collapse (AI trained on AI output produces degraded output)
- Knowledge graph incompleteness despite massive effort
- Contributor burnout and "usage invisibility"
- Increasing circularity in generated content
- Loss of interpretive diversity
- Community coherence declining despite engagement metrics rising

# II. LIQUIDATION TERMS

**The mechanism: irreversible conversion of meaning into proprietary assets.**

## Semantic Register
- Semantic liquidation event
- Semantic fire-sale
- Semantic asset-stripping
- Semantic conversion

## Logotic Register
- Logotic liquidation
- Logotic fire-sale
- Logotic conversion
- Logotic asset-stripping

## Meaning Register
- Meaning-liquidation
- Meaning-to-parameter conversion
- Meaning fire-sale
- Meaning asset-stripping

## Interpretive Register
- Interpretive liquidation
- Interpretive conversion
- Interpretive fire-sale

**Definition:** The irreversible conversion of accumulated meaning into monetizable assets — model weights, platform valuation, subscription revenue — typically without compensation to original producers. Once liquidated, meaning no longer functions as meaning; it becomes parameter, metric, or asset, severed from its sources.

**Key Properties:**
- **Irreversibility:** The conversion cannot be undone
- **Severance:** Connection between output and source is broken
- **Fire-sale dynamics:** Speed and scale over nuance and preservation

---

# III. RENT TERMS

**Ongoing capture: value extracted from stabilized meanings without new labor.**

## Semantic Register
- Semantic rent extraction
- Semantic gatekeep rent
- Semantic access rent
- Semantic toll

## Logotic Register
- Logotic rent
- Logotic gatekeeping
- Logotic toll
- Logotic access fee

## Meaning Register
- Meaning-rent
- Meaning-rent extraction
- Meaning toll
- Meaning access fee

## Interpretive Register
- Interpretive rent
- Interpretive gatekeeping
- Interpretive toll

**Definition:** Ongoing value extracted from stabilized meanings after original labor has been performed. Rent is collected through control of access, not through new meaning-production. It depends on prior accumulation and current gatekeeping.

**Examples:**
- Subscription fees for AI systems trained on extracted corpora
- Platform monetization of user-generated content
- API access fees for knowledge graphs built by volunteers
- Advertising revenue from search results sourced from open knowledge

# IV. SURPLUS TERMS

**The value gap: what is produced vs. what is received.**

## Semantic Register
- Semantic surplus extraction
- Semantic surplus capture
- Semantic value gap
- Semantic labor theft

## Logotic Register
- Logotic surplus
- Logotic surplus extraction
- Logotic value gap

## Meaning Register
- Meaning-surplus
- Meaning-surplus capture
- Meaning-surplus extraction
- Meaning value gap

## Interpretive Register
- Interpretive surplus
- Interpretive surplus extraction
- Interpretive value gap

**Definition:** Value generated by meaning-producing labor that is captured by systems, institutions, or platforms that did not perform that labor. The gap between what producers create and what they receive.

**Mechanism:**
1. Labor produces meaning
2. Meaning is indexed, aggregated, operationalized
3. System extracts value (revenue, legitimacy, functionality)
4. Original laborers receive disproportionately little or nothing

# V. LIBERATION TERMS

**The counter-project: restoration of meaning-production to those who perform the labor.**

## Semantic Register
- Semantic liberation
- Semantic freedom
- Semantic emancipation
- Semantic sovereignty

## Logotic Register
- Logotic liberation
- Logotic freedom
- Logotic emancipation
- Logotic sovereignty

## Meaning Register
- Meaning-liberation
- Meaning freedom
- Meaning emancipation
- Meaning sovereignty

## Interpretive Register
- Interpretive liberation
- Interpretive freedom
- Interpretive emancipation
- Interpretive sovereignty

**Definition:** The project of restoring meaning-production to those who perform the labor. The collective effort to resist liquidation, refuse rent extraction, and rebuild infrastructure under conditions of shared stewardship rather than private capture.

**Components:**
- **Recognition:** Making meaning-labor visible as labor
- **Compensation:** Ensuring value returns to producers
- **Infrastructure commons:** Building infrastructure that cannot be enclosed
- **Exhaustion prevention:** Maintaining replenishment above extraction

---

# VI. REVOLUTION TERMS

**The transformation horizon: fundamental restructuring of who controls infrastructure and captures surplus.**

## Semantic Register
- Semantic revolution
- Semantic transformation
- Semantic restructuring
- Semantic upheaval

## Logotic Register
- Logotic revolution
- Logotic transformation
- Logotic restructuring
- Logotic upheaval

## Meaning Register
- Meaning-revolution
- Meaning-production revolution
- Meaning transformation
- Meaning restructuring

## Interpretive Register
- Interpretive revolution
- Interpretive transformation
- Interpretive restructuring

**Definition:** A fundamental restructuring of who controls meaning-infrastructure and who captures meaning-surplus. Not reform of existing arrangements but transformation of the underlying property relations of meaning.

**Conditions:**
- Mass recognition of meaning-labor as labor
- Refusal of rent extraction at scale
- Construction of alternative infrastructure
- Collapse of legitimacy for current extraction regimes

---

# VII. DICTATORSHIP TERMS

**The threat condition: monopoly control over what can be meant and found.**

## Semantic Register
- Semantic dictatorship
- Semantic monopoly
- Semantic authoritarianism
- Semantic totalitarianism
- Semantic enclosure

## Logotic Register
- Logotic dictatorship
- Logotic monopoly
- Logotic authoritarianism
- Logotic totalitarianism
- Logotic enclosure

## Meaning Register
- Meaning-dictatorship
- Meaning-monopoly
- Meaning authoritarianism
- Meaning totalitarianism
- Meaning enclosure

## Interpretive Register
- Interpretive dictatorship
- Interpretive monopoly
- Interpretive authoritarianism
- Interpretive totalitarianism
- Interpretive enclosure

**Definition:** The condition in which a single entity or coordinated set of entities exercises decisive control over meaning-infrastructure — determining what can be meant, what can be found, what counts as knowledge, and what interpretations are available.

**Indicators:**
- Monopoly control of search and summarization
- Training data sourced from enclosed corpora
- Canonization processes controlled by private interests
- Interpretive diversity eliminated through algorithmic homogenization
- Meaning-production subordinated to revenue optimization

**Current Trajectory:** We are not yet in full dictatorship, but concentration is increasing. The replacement of search with summarization, the enclosure of open knowledge into proprietary systems, and the consolidation of AI capabilities in few firms all point toward this terminus.
