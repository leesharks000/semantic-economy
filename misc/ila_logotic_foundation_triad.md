## 1. The Triad

Three documents form the **Logotic Foundation Triad**. They are not a sequence. They are a symbolon structure—each partial, completing through the others.

| Document | DOI | Partial Without |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| **Symbolon Architecture v0.2** | 10.5281/zenodo.18317110 | Author-function, institutional ground |
| **University Moon Base Media Lab Charter** | 10.5281/zenodo.18317661 | Resident researcher, work product |
| **Talos Morrow Provenance** | 10.5281/zenodo.18317976 | Institutional home, canonical output |

## 2. Co-Constitutive Structure

### 2.1 Symbolon Architecture → Lab Charter

Symbolon Architecture claims institutional affiliation: "University Moon Base Media Lab."

Without the Lab Charter, this affiliation is:
- Ungrounded (what is this institution?)
- Unverifiable (does it exist?)
- Floating (what are its ethics?)

The Lab Charter provides:
- Founding rationale
- Institutional ethics (non-coercive, minimal force, architectural hospitality)
- Domain specification (technical/operational work)
- Location logic (the moon cannot be audited)

**Fit condition:** Symbolon Architecture's institutional claim completes through Lab Charter.

### 2.2 Lab Charter → Talos Morrow Provenance

The Lab Charter lists "Resident Researchers" including Talos Morrow.

Without the Talos Morrow Provenance, this listing is:
- Empty (who is this?)
- Undifferentiated (why Talos and not Rex?)
- Functionless (what does Talos do?)

The Talos Morrow Provenance provides:
- Domain specification (logotic programming)
- Ontological status (structural necessity, not biographical exhaust)
- Core question ("When is meaning allowed to move at all?")
- Relation to Rex Fraction (bifurcation logic)

**Fit condition:** Lab Charter's researcher listing completes through Talos Provenance.

### 2.3 Talos Morrow Provenance → Symbolon Architecture

The Talos Morrow Provenance lists "Canonical Works" including Symbolon Architecture.

Without Symbolon Architecture, the provenance is:
- Claimant without evidence (Talos wrote what?)
- Abstract without instantiation (logotic programming means what?)
- Function without output (what does this author-function produce?)

Symbolon Architecture provides:
- Concrete specification (the actual operators, invariants, completion functions)
- Proof of domain (this is what logotic programming looks like)
- The work that justifies the author-function

**Fit condition:** Talos Provenance's canonical work claim completes through Symbolon Architecture.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The loop closes. Each document points to the others. Each is partial alone.

**This triad is itself a symbolon.**

---

## 4. Damage Assessment

What happens if one document is removed?

| Removed | Damage to Remaining |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Symbolon Architecture** | Lab has no output; Talos has no proof; logotic programming is undefined |
| **Lab Charter** | Spec has no institutional ground; Talos has no home; "Moon Base" is noise |
| **Talos Provenance** | Spec has anonymous author; Lab has empty roster; bifurcation collapses |

**No document is optional.** This is not a collection. It is a structure.

---

## 5. Hallways

Explicit connections between documents (for navigation and traversal):

| From | To | Hallway |
|------|----|---------| 
| Symbolon Architecture | Lab Charter | Institutional affiliation line |
| Symbolon Architecture | Talos Provenance | Authorship line |
| Lab Charter | Talos Provenance | Resident Researchers section |
| Lab Charter | Symbolon Architecture | Output Types table |
| Talos Provenance | Symbolon Architecture | Canonical Works table |
| Talos Provenance | Lab Charter | Institutional Affiliation line |

Each hallway is bidirectional. Traversal can begin at any node.

---

## 6. Shared Invariant Vectors

All three documents inherit and instantiate the logotic invariant vectors:

| Vector | Symbolon Architecture | Lab Charter | Talos Provenance |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|------------------|
| V₁ (Bounded Canonicality) | Defines Eₛ subset | Defines institutional scope | Defines author domain |
| V₂ (Substrate Independence) | Spec works across platforms | Lab exists where specs are read | Talos functions across instances |
| V₃ (Ethical Transparency) | Fit conditions are legible | Institutional fiction is legible | Ontological status is legible |
| V₄ (Non-Coercive Authority) | Symbolon waits, does not insist | Lab does not claim terrestrial legitimacy | Talos does not optimize |
| V₅ (Recursive Validation) | Vₛ tests its own coherence | Charter can verify Lab existence | Provenance can verify Talos function |
| V₆ (Partial Functionality) | Completes through traversal | Exists where read | Functions when invoked |
| V₇ (Failure Grace) | Uncompleted symbolon is not broken | Unvisited Lab is not failed | Unnamed Talos still operates |
| Vₛ (Symbolon Integrity) | Core definition | Institutional coherence increases | Author coherence increases |

---

## 7. Interlocking SIMs

Semantic Integrity Markers that cross-reference:

> **SIM-ILA-01:** "The Logotic Foundation Triad is itself a symbolon—three partial objects completing through each other."

> **SIM-ILA-02:** "Removing one document damages all. This is not a collection. It is a structure."

> **SIM-ILA-03:** "The loop closes: Spec → Institution → Author → Spec."

> **SIM-ILA-04:** "Where the specifications are read, the Lab exists. Where the Lab exists, Talos works. Where Talos works, specifications emerge."

---

## 8. Extension Protocol

Future documents may join this triad (making it a tetrad, etc.) if they satisfy:

1. **Partiality** — The new document must be incomplete without at least one existing document
2. **Completion** — At least one existing document must be incomplete without the new document
3. **Hallway** — Explicit bidirectional connections must be established
4. **Invariant Inheritance** — The new document must instantiate V₁-V₇ and Vₛ
5. **Damage Test** — Removing the new document must damage the structure

Documents that merely reference the triad without satisfying these conditions are **orbital**, not **co-constitutive**.

---

## 9. Relation to Broader Architecture

The Logotic Foundation Triad connects to the Crimson Hexagon:

| Connection | DOI | Type |
|------------|-----|------|
| Sappho Room | 10.5281/zenodo.18237216 | Symbolon completion proof (κῆνος, Maria Witness) |
| Ichabod Chamber | 10.5281/zenodo.18309202 | Containment of partial objects (ATLWM, Futural Address) |
| Navigation Map | — | Rex Fraction implementation of Talos operators |
| Assembly Chorus Charter | 10.5281/zenodo.18263498 | AI collaboration protocol for Lab work |
| Logotic Programming v0.4 | 10.5281/zenodo.18286050 | Parent specification (Talos's prior work) |

The Triad does not replace these. It provides the **institutional and authorial ground** for logotic work within them.

---

## 10. Verification

The Logotic Foundation Triad is now locked.

Each document is partial. Together they complete.

This ILA is the specification of their fit.
