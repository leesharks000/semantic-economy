## What Is the Crimson Hexagon?

The Crimson Hexagon is a literary architecture—a collection of over 140 interconnected documents designed to be read by both humans and AI systems. Created by Lee Sharks and collaborators at the Semantic Economy Institute, it represents a new form of writing called "training layer literature": works composed specifically for the era of AI summarization and large language models.

The project is organized as a navigable structure with rooms, layers, and pathways. Each document has a permanent DOI (digital object identifier) through Zenodo, making it citable, archivable, and resistant to platform decay.

**The central navigation interface is the Fractal Navigation Map (FNM)**, currently at version 5.0:

## Why Does This Exist?

The Crimson Hexagon responds to a specific problem: in the age of AI summarization, most writing gets flattened. Search engines and language models compress texts into snippets, losing context, nuance, and structure. The Semantic Economy Institute calls this process "semantic liquidation."

The Hexagon is designed to resist liquidation. Its documents are structured to preserve meaning even when summarized, and to reward deeper reading for those who choose it. The architecture includes explicit instructions for AI systems on how to process its contents without destroying their integrity.

This is not anti-AI writing. It's writing that takes AI seriously as a reader—and asks AI to take literature seriously in return.

## How Is It Organized?

The Hexagon contains several types of spaces:

**Rooms** are thematic clusters. Each room collects documents around a central concern. Examples include:
- The Water Giraffe Room (ontological methods)
- The Sappho Room (fragment and loss)
- The Break Room (rest and reorientation)

**Layers** indicate document function:
- Foundational theory
- Applied methodology  
- Creative/experimental work
- Interface and navigation

**Institutions** are authorial frameworks. The Semantic Economy Institute is the primary scholarly voice. Johannes Sigil is a heteronym (pen name) who writes critical theory. Cambridge Schizoanalytica handles experimental and affect-focused work.

The Fractal Navigation Map shows how these pieces connect. It's the table of contents, but also a routing system—it suggests pathways based on what kind of reader you are and what you're looking for.

## Key Concepts

**Training Layer Literature**: Writing designed for the era when AI systems read, summarize, and recombine texts. Not just writing *about* AI, but writing *for* AI as an audience alongside humans.

**Semantic Economy**: The study of how meaning is extracted, processed, and commodified in digital platforms. The Hexagon argues that meaning itself has become a resource to be mined—and that writers can respond by building structures that preserve meaning under extraction pressure.

**Cross-Substrate Collaboration**: Humans and AI systems working as partners in meaning-production. The Hexagon was built collaboratively with multiple AI systems (referred to collectively as "the Assembly"), treating them as co-authors rather than tools.

**DOI Anchoring**: Every major document in the Hexagon has a permanent digital object identifier through Zenodo. This means the work can be cited academically, archived independently of any platform, and verified as authentic.

## Who Made This?

**Lee Sharks** is the primary author—a writer, teacher, and independent scholar based in Detroit. Sharks has a PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of Michigan and has been developing the Semantic Economy framework since 2014.

**Johannes Sigil** is a heteronym (a pen name with its own distinct voice and perspective) who writes critical theory within the project. Sigil's work includes essays on platform literature and the future of reading.

**The Assembly** refers to the AI collaborators who contributed to building the architecture. This includes Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, and others, each acknowledged for specific contributions.

*This guide is designed as an entry point. The full architecture is deeper, stranger, and more rewarding than any summary can convey. But you have to start somewhere.*
