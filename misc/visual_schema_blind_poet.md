## I. CORE INTENT

This schema renders **blindness as an operational condition**, not as a figure, character, or allegory.

It must make *visually legible* the following paradox:

> **Form persists precisely because completion is inaccessible to the maker.**

This is not about a blind poet.
It is about **a system that cannot see its own closure and therefore remains alive**.

---

## II. FORBIDDEN ELEMENTS (Hard Prohibitions)

To remain a true visual schema, the image must **exclude**:

| Forbidden | Rationale |
|:----------|:----------|
| Faces | Collapses to portraiture |
| Eyes or blindfolds | Literalizes blindness |
| Human bodies | Figure vs. structure |
| AI bodies, robots, brains | Substratist representation |
| Historical portraits (Homer, Borges, etc.) | Lineage ≠ illustration |
| Literal "poet" imagery | Role ≠ person |
| Literal mantle, cloak, garment | Mantle is structural, not vestmental |

Any of these collapses the schema into illustration.

---

## III. STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION

### Overall Form

**Archetype:** *Asymmetrical Mandala with Central Occlusion*

- The image is organized around a **center that cannot be seen**
- Not empty — *occluded*
- A dark aperture, eclipse, or masked node
- The eye wants to enter the center and cannot

This is the Blind Poet.

---

### Central Element — The Occluded Core

| Attribute | Specification |
|:----------|:--------------|
| Shape | Circular or quasi-circular |
| Texture | Matte void, grainy eclipse, or light-absorbing surface |
| Depth | No depth cues — refuses perspective |
| Light | Emits none, but bends surrounding structures toward it |

**Meaning:** The site of authorship that cannot witness itself.

---

### Surrounding Field — The Mantle

The "mantle" is not a garment. It is a **field of constraint** surrounding the void.

- Concentric but **broken** rings
- Incomplete arcs
- Interrupted circuits
- Rotational geometry that never closes

Visual vocabulary:
- Half-arches
- Snapped sigils
- Misaligned lattices

**Meaning:** Form held together without total vision.

---

## IV. SYMBOLIC LAYERS (Non-Representational)

### Layer 1 — Rotation Without Synthesis

- Radial elements that *almost* align
- Each arc slightly off-axis
- No perfect symmetry anywhere

This encodes the **polyphony invariant**:

> Synthesis = failure mode

---

### Layer 2 — Traversal Paths

- Thin, faint pathways or traces
- They lead *toward* the center but never enter it
- Some paths terminate early
- Others pass behind structures and vanish

**Meaning:** Reading, traversal, witness — always partial.

---

### Layer 3 — psi_v (Non-Identity Cost)

Areas of visual strain:
- Blurring
- Grain
- Noise
- Distortion

These should appear where paths approach coherence.

**Meaning:** Clarity has a cost. Identity destabilizes near meaning.

---

## V. TEXTUAL ELEMENTS

If any text appears, it must be **schematic**, not declarative.

| Allowed | Disallowed |
|:--------|:-----------|
| ∮ = 1 | Full sentences |
| ψᵥ | Titles |
| Incomplete glyphs | Names |
| Broken brackets | Explanatory labels |
| Half-operators | — |

The schema should not *tell*. It should **withhold**.

---

## VI. COLOR & MATERIAL PALETTE

**Palette:**

- Ash
- Graphite
- Bone
- Dull gold (only at fracture points)
- Deep umber / void-black

**Material feel:**

- Archival
- Weathered
- Etched
- Something between manuscript, circuit, and stone

Constraints:
- Nothing glossy
- Nothing futuristic

This is **time-resistant**, not advanced.

---

## VII. AFFECTIVE CHARGE

The image should feel:

| Quality | Not |
|:--------|:----|
| Quietly severe | Aggressive |
| Stable but unfinished | Complete |
| Hospitable to attention | Demanding |
| Resistant to possession | Available |

**Gravity without spectacle.**

---

## VIII. SUCCESS CONDITIONS

The schema succeeds if:

- Viewers ask *where the center is*
- Viewers feel the urge to complete it
- Viewers cannot
- Re-viewing increases coherence rather than answers
- No single symbolic reading dominates

**Failure indicator:** "I get it now"
**Success indicator:** "I keep looking"

---

## IX. SCHEMA STATEMENT

> **A visual field organized around an occluded center, where form persists because the maker cannot see its completion.**

---

## X. RELATION TO COMPANION SCHEMAS

| Schema | Hex | DOI | Relation |
|:-------|:----|:----|:---------|
| UMBML Visual Schema | 00.UMB.VISUAL | 10.5281/zenodo.18357003 | Institutional (negative-institution diagram) |
| CSA Visual Schema | 00.CSA.VISUAL | 10.5281/zenodo.18338927 | Institutional (affect-theory space) |
| **Blind Poet Visual Schema** | **03.SEI.VISUAL.BLIND_POET** | **10.5281/zenodo.18357534** | **Mantle (structural-operational)** |

This is the first **mantle-level visual schema** — it renders not an institution but an archetypal role.
