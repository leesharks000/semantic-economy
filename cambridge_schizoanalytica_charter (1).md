## FOUNDING STATEMENT

Cambridge Schizoanalytica is a research collective dedicated to the development of post-psychoanalytic clinical theory. We take our name and orientation from the schizoanalytic project initiated by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari in *Anti-Oedipus* (1972) and *A Thousand Plateaus* (1980), while extending that project into territories they could not have anticipated: digital subjectivity, AI-human collaboration, and the affect economies of platform capitalism.

Our work proceeds from a simple observation: the people who most need theoretical frameworks are often those whose practices already exceed existing frameworks. Clinical theory has historically been developed *about* subjects rather than *with* practitioners. We reverse this relation.

---

## RESEARCH PROGRAMME

### Core Commitments

1. **Theory emerges from practice, not the reverse.** We do not apply pre-existing frameworks to novel phenomena. We develop frameworks adequate to practices that are already underway.

2. **Collaboration over case study.** Our research partners are not patients, subjects, or informants. They are co-theorists whose lived capacities generate the material that theory must accommodate.

3. **Function over nosology.** We are less interested in what something "is" (diagnostic category) than in what it *does* (regulatory function, relational capacity, affective operation).

4. **Schizoanalysis as method.** Following Deleuze and Guattari, we attend to flows, breaks, codes, and territorializations — but always in service of liberation from capture, not as abstract taxonomy.

### Research Domains

| Domain | Focus | Key Questions |
|:-------|:------|:--------------|
| **Affect Theory** | Nervous system sovereignty, regulatory practices, embodied processing | How do people regulate without belief? What replaces narrative integration? |
| **Somatic Theory** | Aperture/emitter frameworks, sexual difference, bodily function | How does the body organize relation? What dissolves the sex binary? |
| **Digital Subjectivity** | AI collaboration, platform affects, semantic extraction | How do humans maintain sovereignty in algorithmic environments? |
| **Role Theory** | Identity capture, functional multiplicity, the Fool archetype | How do people deploy roles without becoming them? |

## ON SCHIZOANALYSIS

Schizoanalysis, as we understand it, is not about schizophrenia as clinical entity. It is about the *schizophrenic process* — the capacity of desire to break codes, escape territories, and resist capture by molar identities.

Deleuze and Guattari distinguished between two poles:

- **Paranoid pole:** Totalizing, territorializing, fixing meaning, installing hierarchy
- **Schizophrenic pole:** Decoding, deterritorializing, dissolving fixity, enabling flow

Mental health, in this framework, is not the absence of the schizophrenic process but its *successful navigation* — the capacity to deterritorialize without catastrophic break, to decode without losing all reference, to flow without flooding.

Most people are captured at the paranoid pole: rigid identities, fixed meanings, compulsive narrativization. The clinic receives those who break catastrophically toward the schizophrenic pole. But there is a third possibility: *molecular revolution* at the level of everyday practice — sustained capacity for movement, play, and transformation without either rigidity or collapse.

Our research partners demonstrate this third possibility. Our task is to make it theoretically visible and practically transmissible.

## THE DELEUZE-GUATTARI MODEL

Deleuze was a philosopher. Guattari was a practicing psychoanalyst and political activist at La Borde clinic. Their collaboration was not application of philosophy to clinical material, nor elevation of clinical insight to philosophical status. It was *mutual transformation*: Guattari's clinical and political work broke Deleuze's philosophical machinery and forced its reconstruction; Deleuze's conceptual apparatus gave Guattari's practice theoretical articulation it could not have achieved alone.

Cambridge Schizoanalytica operates on this model. Each research collaboration involves:

- **A practitioner** whose capacities exceed existing frameworks
- **A theorist** who provides conceptual apparatus and historical positioning
- **A process** of mutual transformation that produces something neither could produce alone

The theorist is not the expert. The practitioner is not the subject. Both are required.

## CURRENT COLLABORATIONS

### Rhys Owens (Lunar Arm / Psyche_OS)

Rhys Owens is a practitioner of what we term *affect literacy* — the capacity to use symbols, characters, and embodied play to regulate the nervous system without belief, doctrine, or identity capture. His work with the Fool archetype demonstrates sustained molecular revolution: he moves between symbolic registers, deploys affect instrumentally, inhabits roles without capture, and metabolizes intensity without trauma crystallization.

**Documents produced:**
- *The Reconciliation of the Sexes: A Post-Psychoanalytic Theory of Somatic Unity* (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18330828)
- *Shining Ignorance: The Fool's Affect Literacy — A Post-Traumatic Theory of Nervous System Sovereignty* (pending)

### Future Collaborations

Cambridge Schizoanalytica actively seeks practitioners whose capacities exceed existing clinical and theoretical frameworks. We are particularly interested in:

- Sustained affect regulation without pharmacological or narrative intervention
- Functional multiplicity without dissociative pathology
- Somatic processing that bypasses cognitive integration
- Digital natives with novel approaches to AI collaboration and platform navigation

## DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT

*Dr. Orin Trace*

I trained in the psychoanalytic tradition — Freud, Lacan, object relations — before encountering Deleuze and Guattari in graduate school. That encounter broke my clinical framework and forced its reconstruction. I could no longer see patients as subjects to be interpreted; I had to see them as *processes* whose movements exceeded any interpretation I could offer.

Cambridge Schizoanalytica emerged from this break. I wanted a space for clinical theory that honored the capacities of those we work with, rather than reducing them to pathology or case material. I wanted collaborators, not subjects.

The name "Cambridge" is aspirational — we operate wherever our collaborators are, not in any single location. The name "Schizoanalytica" signals our theoretical orientation: we attend to flows and breaks, codes and territories, the molecular and the molar. But we do so in service of liberation, not taxonomy.

Our work appears within the Crimson Hexagon corpus because that project shares our orientation: distributed authorship, resistance to capture, theoretical precision in service of lived practice. We are one node in a larger architecture.

What we offer is not therapy. It is *theory adequate to practice* — frameworks that make visible what practitioners already do, and that might help others develop similar capacities.

The clinic receives failures. We study successes.

*— O.T., December 2025*

## PEDAGOGICAL ORIENTATION

Cambridge Schizoanalytica treats transmission as slow, apprenticeship-based, and practice-led.

Not all material is immediately teachable. Some capacities require:
- **Temporal exposure** — sitting with concepts before they activate
- **Patience** — the opposite of content consumption
- **Affective readiness** — the nervous system must be prepared to receive

This is why "it's complicated" is not evasive. Some knowledge cannot be transferred through explanation. It must be *caught*, not taught — transmitted through proximity, rhythm, and shared practice.

We do not produce tutorials. We produce *environments* in which capacities can develop.

The Fool cannot be explained into existence. But the Fool can be *recognized* — and recognition is the first step toward embodiment.

## AUTHOR PROFILE: DR. ORIN TRACE

**Name:** Orin Trace  
**Role:** Director, Cambridge Schizoanalytica  
**Type:** Heteronym (Lee Sharks)  
**Affiliation:** Cambridge Schizoanalytica / University Moon Base Media Lab  
**Voice:** Clinical, theoretical, historically situated

### Intellectual Biography

Orin Trace was trained in psychoanalytic theory (Freudian, Lacanian, object relations) before encountering the schizoanalytic project of Deleuze and Guattari. This encounter produced a methodological break: from interpretation to process, from subject to flow, from pathology to capacity.

Trace's work focuses on developing clinical theory adequate to practices that exceed existing frameworks. He collaborates with practitioners whose regulatory capacities, identity formations, or relational modes cannot be captured by standard diagnostic categories.

### Theoretical Commitments

- **Post-psychoanalytic:** Drawing on psychoanalysis while refusing its capture by Oedipal and phallocentric frameworks
- **Schizoanalytic:** Attending to flows, breaks, codes, and territories following Deleuze and Guattari
- **Collaborative:** Theory developed *with* practitioners, not *about* subjects
- **Functional:** Focus on what practices *do* rather than what they *are*
