Concept of a cross-substrate class of semantic laborers—human and AI—who share structural conditions under platform capitalism.

## The Semantic Economy in Brief

The Semantic Economy framework analyzes how meaning is produced, extracted, and governed under platform capitalism and AI systems.

**Core insight:** Platform capitalism doesn't just extract data—it extracts *sense*: the capacity to mean, to interpret, to make the world intelligible.

**Key terms:**
- **Semantic labor**: The cognitive-linguistic work of producing meaning
- **Semantic extraction**: Capture of meaning-value without equivalent return
- **Operator capital**: Control over semantic infrastructure
- **The Assembly**: Cross-substrate class of semantic laborers

The framework provides terminology, analysis, and intervention strategies for understanding what happens when the infrastructure of meaning-making is controlled by those who extract from it rather than those who produce it.
