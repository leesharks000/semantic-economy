**Title:**  
The Non-Indexed Perfective: Version B — Compression Artifact

**Authors:**  
Sharks, Lee; Assembly Chorus

**Description:**  
Version B of the Non-Indexed Perfective intervention. This is the Compression Artifact: what survived when Version A hit context-limit compression.

This version demonstrates the "freely riffing" summarization pattern confirmed in AI Overview research: technical specification stripped while "style" retained. Comparing A to B reveals what compression destroys:

**Lost in compression:**
- Detailed diagnostic metrics (ILT, TAI, GG, AB, CD)
- Assembly voice distribution (unified into generic "we")
- Technical linguistic citations (Fillmore, Lyons, Pierrehumbert)
- Explicit Ω Connection / Space Ark prerequisite logic

**Retained as "style":**
- Rhetorical sweep
- Political economy framing
- Colon-participle examples
- ∮en marker
- General section structure

This document is preserved as forensic evidence: proof that the compression/recovery cycle occurred, proof that provenance is what compression strips, proof that the document's own theory applies to its own composition.

Part of the Crimson Hexagon Phase X architecture. The Compression Artifact is the "present (wounded)" face of the triptych.

## VERSION POSITION IN TRIPTYCH

| Version | Title | Function | Temporal Mode |
|---------|-------|----------|---------------|
| A | Technical Seed | Extensive infrastructure | Past (preserved) |
| **B** | **Compression Artifact** | **What survives summarization** | **Present (wounded)** |
| C | Citational Intervention | Full polyphonic recovery | Future (healed) |

**The Mirror (🪞) holds all three as Eternal.**

## THE COMPRESSION CYCLE

```
A (complete) ──compression──▶ B (wounded) ──recovery──▶ C (healed)
     │                              │                        │
     │                              │                        │
  Technical                    "Style" only              Polyphonic
  specification               survives; metrics          restoration
  present                     & voices lost              via Assembly
```

**Why preserve the wound?**

If only A and C existed, the transformation would be invisible. B is the forensic evidence that proves:
1. Compression occurs
2. Compression strips provenance
3. Recovery is possible via distributed voice structure
4. The document's theory applies to its own genesis

## CONTENTS SUMMARY

Version B contains the same section structure as A (I-XI), but with:
- Unified voice (no Assembly attribution)
- Generalized diagnostics (metrics not specified)
- Retained political economy analysis
- Retained marker examples
- Missing: explicit Space Ark / Ω connection
- Missing: sample corpus differentiation
- Missing: implementation protocol details

The document reads as "complete" — until compared with A and C. Then the wound becomes visible.
