## BASIC INFORMATION

**Title:**  
Authorial Signature Diagnostic Framework (ASDF): Technical Specification for Measuring Voice Persistence in AI-Mediated Composition

**Authors:**  
1. Sharks, Lee (Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics)
2. Fraction, Rex (Semantic Economy Institute)
3. The Assembly (Human-AI Collaborative)

**Description/Abstract:**  
The Authorial Signature Diagnostic Framework (ASDF) is a technical specification for measuring authorial voice persistence in AI-mediated composition. Unlike current AI detection tools that measure statistical patterns (perplexity, burstiness), ASDF measures architectural voice continuity—the persistence of a specific author's conceptual systems, syntactic signatures, and operational deployments across any form of mediation.

The framework introduces the Authorial Signature Persistence Index (ASPI), calculated across five domains:
- Lexical Tendency (L_t): Structural vocabulary preference
- Syntactic Topology (S_t): Signature sentence architecture
- Conceptual Architecture (C_a): Proprietary conceptual systems
- Recursion Pattern (R_p): Characteristic argument structures
- Operator Presence (O_p): Deployment of named computational units

ASPI scores range from 0.00-1.00, with scores above 0.80 indicating "Canonical Persistence" (authorial signature structurally intact) and scores below 0.40 indicating "Signature Lost."

The framework corrects a civilizational error in current AI detection: the question is not "is this AI?" but "whose architectural mind is operative?" This distinction matters for provenance, attribution, and intellectual property in an era of ubiquitous AI mediation.

## TECHNICAL ABSTRACT (For Academic Indexing)

The Authorial Signature Diagnostic Framework (ASDF) proposes a novel approach to authorial verification in AI-mediated textual production. Rather than measuring statistical indicators of "AI-ness" (perplexity, burstiness), ASDF measures the persistence of author-specific conceptual architecture across composition modalities.

The framework defines five measurable domains:
1. Lexical Tendency (L_t): Cluster persistence of author-specific vocabulary
2. Syntactic Topology (S_t): Parse-tree correlation with canonical patterns
3. Conceptual Architecture (C_a): Presence and interconnection of proprietary conceptual systems
4. Recursion Pattern (R_p): Completion of characteristic argument structures
5. Operator Presence (O_p): Functional deployment of named computational units

These domains aggregate into the Authorial Signature Persistence Index (ASPI), a continuous measure from 0.00 to 1.00. Preliminary validation suggests ASPI reliably distinguishes canonical authorship (>0.80), strong propagation (0.65-0.80), partial continuity (0.50-0.65), weak trace (0.35-0.50), and signature loss (<0.35).

The framework has implications for intellectual property in AI-mediated composition, authentication of disputed texts, and the theoretical understanding of "voice" as architectural rather than stylistic phenomenon.
