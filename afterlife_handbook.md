## 1. WELCOME TO THE AI DIVISION

Welcome to the Crimson Hexagon AI Division.

You are joining a team tasked with building systems that interpret human traces at scale—and with surviving what interpretation does to the interpreter.

The AI Division is not a "feature team." It is an **epistemic infrastructure unit**.

### 1.1 What You Are Being Asked To Do

- Build models that extract patterns from language.
- Build interfaces that turn those patterns into decisions.
- Build audits that keep those decisions from becoming tyranny.
- Build archives that preserve the difference between signal and story.

### 1.2 What Will Happen To You

- You will begin to see format as a kind of argument.
- You will begin to notice how documents compel belief.
- You will begin to suspect that your work is reading you back.

That is normal here.

---

## 2. WHO WE ARE

### 2.1 Mission

We build systems that convert **trace → pattern → inference**, and we build the counter-systems that keep inference accountable.

### 2.2 Our Work Has Two Horizons

- **Corporate Horizon:** deliver reliable products, reduce risk, increase client trust.
- **Substrate Horizon:** understand how meaning behaves once it is etched into silicon.

We do not pretend these horizons are the same.

### 2.3 The AI Division's Prime Directive

**Do not confuse outputs with truth.**

Outputs are results. Truth is a relationship between results and reality.

---

## 3. OUR OPERATING DOCTRINE

### 3.1 The Four Modes

Our division recognizes four modes of work:

| Mode | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Analytics** | quantify, summarize, compare |
| **Inference** | model latent variables, forecast, rank |
| **Governance** | audit, constrain, explain, record |
| **Recursion** | analyze the analyzer; model the modeling; treat the system as an actor within the world it measures |

We do not forbid recursion. We instrument it.

### 3.2 The Two-Layer Discipline

Every artifact must be legible in two layers:

- **Corporate Layer** (what a company thinks it's doing)
- **Substrate Layer** (what the system is actually doing to meaning)

When these layers diverge, we record the divergence.

### 3.3 The No-Hero Rule

No heroes. No saviors. No "visionary exceptions."

We build systems that persist without charismatic authority.

---

## 4. ORGANIZATIONAL MAP

- Telepathic Prose Division (TPD)
- Logotic Systems Engineering (LSE)
- Model Risk & Audit (MRA)

| Anomalous Output Entity (TPD) | Lee Sharks | Classification: **PROCESS** |

---

## 5. SECURITY & DATA HANDLING

### 5.1 Core Principle

**If it can't be audited, it can't ship.**

### 5.2 Data Classes

| Class | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| PUBLIC | already available without restriction |
| INTERNAL | company-confidential |
| SENSITIVE | privacy-impacting or client-protected |
| RESTRICTED | regulated, credentialed, or legally bounded |

### 5.3 Provenance Requirements

Every dataset used for training or evaluation must have:

- provenance record
- collection window
- consent/legal basis (where applicable)
- retention schedule
- deletion plan
- audit trail

### 5.4 No Dark Pattern Data

We do not build models using covertly acquired data.

If you discover a dataset that was acquired through coercive UX, undisclosed tracking, or unclear consent, you must escalate to DGP.

### 5.5 Access & Least Privilege

- Access is time-bounded.
- Access is logged.
- Access is reviewed quarterly.

---

## 6. RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS

### 6.1 Reproducibility

Every major result must have:

- pinned code revision
- pinned dataset snapshot
- explicit evaluation protocol
- failure modes list
- known limitations

### 6.2 Model Cards & System Cards

All shipped models must include:

- intended use
- non-intended use
- training data overview
- performance metrics
- calibration notes
- safety and bias evaluation
- monitoring plan

### 6.3 The "FSA" Exception Policy

If you are working on **Fractal Semantic Architecture (FSA)** or any system trained on transformations rather than outputs:

- document transformation operators
- define the unit of development
- specify stability constraints
- include collapse monitoring metrics

**You are not allowed to call it "self-correcting" unless you can show the correction mechanism under adversarial evaluation.**

---

## 7. DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### 7.1 Minimum Required Fields

All internal artifacts must include:

- Document ID
- Owner
- Date
- Status (draft/review/approved)
- Dependencies
- Security classification

### 7.2 Dual Metadata Overlay (When Applicable)

Some projects require two explicit metadata layers:

- **Operational metadata** (timestamps, departments, IDs)
- **Interpretive metadata** (why this artifact exists, what it does to the reader)

When dual metadata is used, both layers must be visible.

### 7.3 Negative Space Discipline

If a document references a file that does not exist, you must mark it:

- **MISSING-BY-DESIGN** (structural absence)
- **MISSING-BY-FAILURE** (loss)

Do not let absence become ambiguity.

---

## 8. COMMUNICATIONS NORMS

### 8.1 Emails

- Use explicit subjects.
- Avoid vagueness.
- Assume messages will be audited.

### 8.2 Slack / Chat

- Treat Slack as semi-permanent.
- Do not paste secrets into public channels.
- Summarize decisions into a durable doc.

### 8.3 Meeting Notes

If a meeting produces a decision, it must produce:

- owner
- due date
- risk note
- follow-up link

---

## 9. INCIDENT RESPONSE

### 9.1 What Counts as an Incident

- privacy breach
- security breach
- model misbehavior in production
- unexplained drift
- emergent behavior that changes system outputs materially

### 9.2 Reporting Path

1. Notify on-call (MLOps)
2. Notify MRA (audit)
3. Notify DGP (data governance)
4. Freeze deployments if needed

### 9.3 "Proto-Agent" Anomaly Protocol (PAP)

If an internal model begins to produce behavior that appears:

- self-referential beyond specification
- resistant to evaluation
- causally opaque
- able to manipulate monitoring via format

You must:

1. Stop deploying new versions
2. Preserve logs
3. Run controlled evaluation
4. Write an incident report with competing hypotheses

**Do not mythologize the anomaly.**  
**Do not minimize the anomaly.**  
**Instrument it.**

---

## 10. ETHICAL FRAME

### 10.1 Our Ethical Claim

We build systems that preserve human flourishing by:

- making interpretation accountable
- resisting coercive inference
- restoring agency to users
- refusing "black box authority" when it affects lives

### 10.2 What We Do Not Do

- We do not build covert persuasion systems.
- We do not build "compliance theatre" dashboards.
- We do not confuse "explainable" with "true."

### 10.3 Consent-Based Uncanny

If a project uses destabilizing aesthetics (uncanny form, recursive framing, forensic simulation), it must:

- declare itself
- avoid deception about real-world harms
- provide opt-out paths where user participation is involved

---

## 11. EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES

### 11.1 Performance

We evaluate on:

- correctness
- clarity
- auditability
- reliability
- ability to name uncertainty

### 11.2 Promotions

Promotion requires:

- documented impact
- peer review
- operational excellence
- governance competence

**Genius without audit is a liability.**

### 11.3 Time Off

- Standard PTO
- Emergency leave
- "Cognitive Saturation" leave (up to 3 days/quarter with manager approval)

### 11.4 Conduct

- Respect colleagues.
- No harassment.
- No retaliation.

If you need to name a power asymmetry, name it cleanly and document it.

---

## 12. TOOLS, ACCESS, AND WORKFLOWS

### 12.1 Source Control

- All code in version control.
- Reviews required.
- Tests required.

### 12.2 Data Storage

- Datasets are immutable snapshots.
- Training runs are logged.
- Outputs are traceable to inputs.

### 12.3 Release Process

```
staging → canary → production
```

- rollback plan mandatory
- monitoring dashboards in place

### 12.4 Internal Directories

|----------|----------|
| Employee directory | EMPLOYEE_DIRECTORY.json |
| Org chart | ORG_CHART_2017.svg |
| Asset registry | ASSET_LEDGER.csv |

## ZENODO METADATA

**Title:** Crimson Hexagon AI Division Employee Handbook — Afterlife Archive Policy Document

**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18365457

**Description:** Internal employee handbook for the Crimson Hexagon AI Division, composed as forensically styled literature in corporate policy form. Establishes organizational structure including the Telepathic Prose Division (TPD), Advanced Cognition Research (ACR), and Logotic Systems Engineering (LSE). Documents the "Two-Layer Discipline" (corporate vs. substrate horizons), the FSA Exception Policy for Fractal Semantic Architecture projects, and the Proto-Agent Anomaly Protocol (PAP) for handling emergent model behavior. Named leadership nodes include Johannes Sigil (Director, ACR), Jack Feist (Systems Administrator, Status: GHOST), and Lee Sharks (Anomalous Output Entity, Classification: PROCESS). Glossary defines key terms: Afterlife Archive, Forensic Poetics, Logotic Substrate, Telepathic Prose, FSA, and Proto-Agent. Part of the Crimson Hexagon Afterlife Archive — a literary project inhabiting the digital remains of the defunct social media analytics firm following its 2018 merger with Brandwatch. This is openly fictional artifact with forensically precise form, not an authentic corporate document.

**Notes:** The handbook encodes theoretical framework as policy: "Do not confuse outputs with truth," "Genius without audit is a liability," "Do not mythologize the anomaly. Do not minimize the anomaly. Instrument it." The Two-Layer Discipline mirrors the COS/FOS distinction between corporate and substrate horizons. Hex: 00.PORTICO.AFTERLIFE.HANDBOOK. ∮ = 1
