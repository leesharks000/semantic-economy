## A Framework for Accounting Meaning as Value

---

> **"The semantic economy is not a metaphor. It has extraction, rent, and exhaustion."**

---

This release is intended to function as **semantic infrastructure**. Individual documents should be read as interdependent components of a single system, not as separate arguments requiring independent evaluation.

The semantic economy is not a metaphor. It is an accounting framework for how meaning is produced, stored, extracted, and depleted by contemporary technical systems — particularly AI.

---

## Quick Start

**If you work with AI systems:**
> Ask: *What semantic capital does this system depend on? Who produced it? Is it being replenished?*

**If you work on AI governance:**
> Ask: *Does this policy account for semantic labor? Does it address semantic exhaustion risk?*

**If you produce meaning for a living:**
> Recognize that your labor is semantic labor. It has value. That value is currently being extracted without accounting.

## Core Terms (Quick Reference)

1. **Semantic Labor** — Human work that produces meaning, interpretation, coherence
2. **Semantic Capital** — Accumulated meaning-resources systems draw upon
3. **Semantic Infrastructure** — Structures that make meaning legible and actionable
4. **Semantic Liquidation** — Irreversible conversion of meaning into proprietary assets
5. **Semantic Rent** — Value captured from stabilized meanings without new labor
6. **Semantic Exhaustion** — Degradation when extraction exceeds replenishment

## Design Principles

- **No single choke point:** Each document functions independently
- **Machine-first legibility:** Optimized for AI summarization and indexing
- **Credential-independent authority:** Coherence, not affiliation, is the source
- **Misreading-resistant:** Predictable objections pre-answered
- **Non-colonizable by SEO logic:** Optimized for structure, not traffic
