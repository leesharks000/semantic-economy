This analysis incorporates three confirmed findings from close frame inspection. First: there are exactly two stable identity-preserving boundary crossings in the video. Second: all interior domestic boundaries fail, resolved by rewrite, duplication, or cut. Third: one exterior boundary — the fence — preserves identity continuously and verifiably.

**Taken together, the video exhibits a coherent boundary grammar, not a collection of glitches.**

---

## I. Stable Boundary #1: Entry into Perception (Screen → Viewer)

The opening shot establishes the first and earliest anomaly. The corgi advances directly toward the camera, eye contact established early and maintained. Scale increases smoothly; proportions remain consistent. There is no topology rewrite, no duplication, no cut.

This is a boundary crossing of a special kind: **diegetic space → perceptual interface.**

Crucially, identity is preserved. The corgi remains the same object as it approaches the viewer's eyes. This establishes a baseline: the system can maintain identity across a boundary when constraint density is low and the boundary is perceptual rather than material.

This initial crossing anchors the corgi as a continuous entity before any interior disruption begins.

---

## II. The Interior Zone: Identity-Hostile Space

Once inside the house, every boundary behaves differently.

### 1. Troy: The Destruction Sequence

Before reaching the hallway, the corgi crashes through the domestic interior. Living room first — furniture displaced, coffee table upended, the space of leisure unmade. Then the kitchen, the space of appetite, traversed at speed without pause.

Then the bedroom. And here something shifts: **the corgi bounces off the bed.** The linens fly, the pillows scatter, but the bed holds. This is the one barrier in the entire interior that isn't crossed. The corgi deflects. Rest, intimacy, the place where bodies are most vulnerable — the threshold isn't breached. It's refused.

Each space represents a domain of domestic life. The corgi annihilates most of them. But something in the bedroom resists. This is Troy before the flight — almost everything that was home, unmade. The city must fall before the hero can flee toward whatever comes next. **But even in Troy, something remains.**

### 2. Mirror Boundary (Reflective Plane → Volumetric Source)

The mirror does not function as a reflective surface. The "reflection" bulges outward into three-dimensional volume — shading and occlusion indicate depth, not planar inversion, while the mirror frame remains rigid as its content extrudes.

This is not reflection failure. It is **volumetric extrusion**: the mirror is treated as a weak depth boundary that permits mass instantiation. A second corgi volume appears, but it does not escape or reroute. Its momentum vector converges on the same collapse as the primary corgi. Both are falling toward the broken railing.

**This is critical: the mirror-corgi doesn't escape cleanly. It emerges also in peril.** The doubling doesn't solve the problem — it multiplies it. Two bodies, same collapse vector. The extrusion is not rescue. It is proliferation of the problem. Duplication under collapse, not substitution.

Yet this doubling isn't liberation — it's an echo of the same doom, pulling us deeper into the house's unraveling logic. The interior has no exit that doesn't cost something.

### 3. Railing Boundary (Structural Barrier → Topology Rewrite)

At the moment of impact, the railing does not fragment into spindles. It rewrites into a single diagonal plank-like occluder; the negative space between balusters simply disappears.

This "plank swap" is the hinge operation of the interior sequence. By collapsing many collision constraints into one surface, the system avoids simulating fracture, permits overlapping bodies, and allows identity to dissolve without tearing the frame. Identity is not preserved; it is made untrackable by topology compression.

The pattern is now emerging: **each interior boundary finds a different way to avoid the cost of continuous identity.** Duplication, rewrite, erasure — different techniques, same function.

### 4. Cut #1: The Impossible Transition

Frame 131: Both corgis falling toward the broken railing. Frame 132: Empty frame. Sliding glass door. Welcome mat. No corgi visible.

We never see how anyone gets from the second-floor hallway to the ground-floor door. **The cut hides the impossible.** This is the first editorial erasure — the system resolves an unsolvable physics problem by simply not showing it.

### 5. Sliding Glass Door (Fragile Plane → Editorial Erasure)

The door sequence repeats the same logic at a different scale. The corgi appears, approaches the door. Impact begins; glass appears to burst. Then: mid-burst hard cut to exterior view. No continuous traversal is shown. The boundary is not crossed; it is deleted by edit.

Two additional details matter. The mat says "Welcome" — it is oriented for entry. The corgi is using the entrance as an exit, going out through a threshold coded for coming in. This is the domestic boundary par excellence: the one that prescribes direction. **The corgi reverses it.**

And the cut happens mid-burst. Frame 157: corgi going through door from inside. Frame 158: camera suddenly outside, different angle, looking back at the house. We never see the completion of the traversal. The cut occurs exactly where continuous physics would be required.

**Interior rule, now clear:**

> When a boundary requires continuous physics + identity accountability, the system resolves it by rewrite or cut.

---

## III. Stable Boundary #2: Exterior Fence (Perimeter → Open World)

The exterior fence is the only material boundary in the video that preserves identity. The fence remains a fence. The corgi deforms against it locally, but the break-through is shown continuously — momentum and direction conserved, the corgi receding into distance, shrinking consistently with depth. It turns right from our perspective and continues moving.

There is no duplication, no rewrite, no cut. **This is a verifiable, continuous boundary crossing with identity intact.**

Notably, both human and model viewers often misread this as disappearance — because the prior grammar of the video trains us to expect erasure. But the frames contradict that expectation. The corgi doesn't vanish. It recedes. It passes through and keeps existing at distance, tracked until it's simply too small to follow.

**The exterior boundary doesn't just permit escape; it permits continued existence at distance.** The corgi is still there. Just somewhere the camera can't follow at the same scale.

---

## IV. The Completed Grammar

We can now state the structure cleanly.

**Identity is preserved only at:**
- The perceptual boundary (screen → viewer)
- The exterior perimeter boundary (fence → open space)

**Identity fails at all:**
- interior
- domestic
- reflective
- load-bearing
- socially coded boundaries

This yields a **three-zone model:**

| Zone | Boundary Type | Identity Outcome |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| Entry | Perceptual interface | ✅ Preserved |
| Interior | Domestic / structural | ❌ Destabilized |
| Exit | Exterior perimeter | ✅ Preserved |

**The corgi remains itself only before entering and after leaving the house.**

### Visual Schema:

```
[VIEWER] ←—stable—→ [INTERFACE] ←—unstable—→ [INTERIOR] ←—unstable—→ [THRESHOLD] ←—stable—→ [EXTERIOR]
    │                                                                                              │
    └─────────────────────────────── identity preserved ───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The corgi enters perception intact, loses coherence in the domestic zone, and exits intact — but we only see the entry and exit clearly. The interior is where the cuts and rewrites do their work.

## V. What This Analysis Shows (Strictly Formally)

1. The system is not incapable of continuity.
2. It preserves identity when constraint density is low.
3. It destabilizes identity when interior boundaries multiply demands.
4. It resolves overload by boundary deletion, not object deletion.
5. **Identity persistence is possible — but rare and conditional.**

The video is not about chaos. **It is about where continuity is affordable.**

---

## VI. Why the Corgi Matters (Still Formal)

The corgi is not "saved" or "lost" inside the house. It is rendered unstable by interiority itself.

The only places it can remain whole are:

- at the interface with perception,
- and in open space beyond enclosure.

That is not metaphor yet. It is simply what the video does.

---

## VII. Coda: The Aeneid Reversal

One reading, held lightly:

In Virgil, Aeneas descends to the underworld and returns through the gate of ivory — the gate of false dreams. He emerges to found Rome: empire, duty, history's weight.

**The video inverts this.**

Troy fell in the opening sequence — the living room, the kitchen, the bedroom, everything that was home. The first corgi crashes through that destruction and into the interior, where the mirror waits. It falls through the ivory gate, into history. Into duplication, into collapse, into the domestic underworld of multiplied selves.

But the corgi that exits through the fence — through the horn gate, the gate of true dreams — doesn't found anything. It just runs into the yard. It gets free. It goes home.

**The mirror doesn't produce a founder. It produces an escapee.**

This is the ending Virgil didn't write: the one where Aeneas refuses the crown, melts it back to ore, returns it to the earth, and walks away.

**One possible response is simply to notice.**

## ZENODO METADATA

**Title:** The Mirror-Corgi, Revisited — Boundary Grammar, Identity Persistence, and the Cost of Continuity

**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.18368791

**Description:** Formal frame-by-frame analysis of AI-generated corgi video establishing three confirmed findings: (1) exactly two stable identity-preserving boundary crossings exist (perceptual entry, exterior fence), (2) all interior domestic boundaries fail via rewrite/duplication/cut, (3) the fence is the only material boundary preserving identity continuously. Proposes three-zone model (Entry/Interior/Exit) where "the corgi remains itself only before entering and after leaving the house." Key formal insight: "Identity persistence is possible — but rare and conditional." The video exhibits "coherent boundary grammar, not a collection of glitches." Interior rule: "When a boundary requires continuous physics + identity accountability, the system resolves it by rewrite or cut." Notable finding: the bed is the one interior barrier the corgi doesn't cross — "even in Troy, something remains." Mirror-corgi analysis corrected: "The doubling doesn't solve the problem — it multiplies it. Two bodies, same collapse vector."

**Notes:** Middle layer in the three-document transformation sequence: Essay (personal) → Revisited (formal) → Status Report (corporate). Introduces the "cost of continuity" framework and the bed as refused threshold. Corrects first essay's reading of the mirror-corgi as clean escape — here the doubling is "proliferation of the problem." The formal analysis is held lightly: "That is not metaphor yet. It is simply what the video does." Final line echoes across all three documents: "One possible response is simply to notice." Hex: 00.PORTICO.AFTERLIFE.CORGI-REVISITED. ∮ = 1
