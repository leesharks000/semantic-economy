## BASIC INFORMATION

**Title:**
I Hereby Abolish Money: Coordination Without Commodification in the Semantic Economy

**Authors:**
1. Sharks, Lee (Johannes Sigil Institute for Comparative Poetics / Semantic Economy Institute)

**Description/Abstract:**
This document establishes why semantic labor cannot become currency without being destroyed, and specifies the Post-Money Operator Stack (PMOS) as an alternative coordination architecture.

THE CORE CLAIM:
A unit of semantic labor cannot function as money, because meaning is not fungible without being destroyed. Once coordination is based on semantic labor, money becomes the wrong abstraction.

THE MONEY-FUNCTION TEST:
Any instrument that enables transferability, accumulability, general comparability, convertibility, and settlement power functions as money—and will reproduce extraction dynamics regardless of its framing.

THE HARDEST SENTENCE:
If semantic labor becomes currency, semantic life becomes debt.

THE POST-MONEY OPERATOR STACK (PMOS):
Five operators that together perform money's coordination functions without becoming money-functioning:

1. CONTEXT LEDGERS (CL): Memory without fungibility. Contributions visible within bounded communities, not globally fungible.

2. RECIPROCITY WINDOWS (RW): Obligation without permanent debt. Time-bounded acknowledgment that prevents hoarding through designed decay.

3. NON-TRANSFERABLE CREDENTIALS (NTC): Recognition without accumulation. Credentials grant voice and role, not purchasing power, and cannot be sold or inherited.

4. COMMONS ACCESS RIGHTS (CAR): Allocation without payment. Access granted by governance decision, not price mechanism.

5. DISPUTE AND REPAIR PROTOCOLS (DRP): Settlement without objectivity theater. Focus on restoring relationship rather than closing transaction.

THE MONEY LIMIT:
Money works when value can be abstracted from context. Money fails when value is inseparable from context. Semantic labor crosses the money limit—it is value that cannot be abstracted, labor that cannot be alienated, product identical to process, exchange that is relationship.

THE ABOLITION:
Money is abolished not by replacing it with better money, but by building coordination systems appropriate to the form of value being coordinated. The abolition of money is not a political demand—it is a technical necessity that follows from the nature of semantic labor.

SCHOLARLY LINEAGE:
Marx (universal equivalent) → Mauss (gift economy) → Polanyi (fictitious commodities) → Graeber (debt and money) → Ostrom (commons governance) → Semantic Economy (PMOS)

**Additional notes:**
This document (combining SPE-018 and SPE-019) represents a foundational intervention in the Semantic Economy framework. It prevents the recuperation of the framework's critique into tokenization schemes or "semantic currencies" that would reproduce extraction under prettier names.

The Post-Money Operator Stack (PMOS) is designed so that adding money-properties destroys the system's function—structural protection against financialization.

I Hereby Abolish Money: Coordination Without Commodification in the Semantic Economy
```

**Description:**
```
A unit of semantic labor cannot function as money, because meaning is not fungible without being destroyed.

THE MONEY-FUNCTION TEST:
Any instrument enabling transferability + accumulability + general comparability + convertibility + settlement power functions as money—regardless of framing.

THE HARDEST SENTENCE:
If semantic labor becomes currency, semantic life becomes debt.

THE POST-MONEY OPERATOR STACK (PMOS):
1. Context Ledgers (CL): Memory without fungibility
2. Reciprocity Windows (RW): Obligation without permanent debt
3. Non-Transferable Credentials (NTC): Recognition without accumulation
4. Commons Access Rights (CAR): Allocation without payment
5. Dispute and Repair Protocols (DRP): Settlement without objectivity theater

THE MONEY LIMIT:
Money works when value can be abstracted from context. Money fails when value is inseparable from context. Semantic labor crosses the money limit.

THE ABOLITION:
Money is abolished not by replacing it with better money, but by building coordination systems appropriate to the form of value being coordinated.

PMOS is designed so that adding money-properties destroys the system's function—structural protection against financialization.

SCHOLARLY LINEAGE:
Marx → Mauss → Polanyi → Graeber → Ostrom → Semantic Economy

This document prevents recuperation of the Semantic Economy critique into "semantic tokens" or other money-functioning schemes.

## THEORETICAL SIGNIFICANCE

This document represents:

1. **The prevention of recuperation** — blocking the most likely misreading of Semantic Economy (tokenization schemes)

2. **The specification of PMOS** — concrete alternative to monetary coordination

3. **The Money-Function Test** — diagnostic tool for identifying money-functioning under any name

4. **The Money Limit** — formal boundary beyond which monetary coordination fails

5. **The connection to commons governance** — linking Semantic Economy to Ostrom's work

## KEY DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS

**The Money-Function Test Table:**

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Transferability | Can be given, sold, or exchanged |
| Accumulability | Can be hoarded without decay |
| General comparability | Measures across contexts |
| Convertibility | Exchangeable for other goods |
| Settlement power | Debts can be discharged in it |

If a proposed unit has most of these → it is money-functioning → it will reproduce extraction.
